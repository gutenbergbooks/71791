<p>“Margy, will you look out on the porch and
see if she’s there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Vi, I will. But you ought to say
please to me, ’cause mother says——”</p>

<p>“All right then. <em>Please</em> look and see if
she’s there,” begged Vi, otherwise Violet
Bunker. There were six of the little Bunkers.
The other four will be out presently.</p>

<p>Margy, who had been looking at picture
books with her year-older sister in a room off
the porch, kindly dropped her book and
started for the door.</p>

<p>“If she’s there bring her in—<em>please</em>.” Violet
laughed a little as she added the last word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
She remembered what Margy had started to
say about politeness.</p>

<p>Violet was piling up the books, for she had
just thought of something new to play, when
Margy came hurrying back into the room.</p>

<p>“She isn’t there!” gasped the smaller
Bunker girl.</p>

<p>“She isn’t?” Violet fairly gasped out the
words, and you could easily tell that she was
very much excited. “Are you sure, Margy?”</p>

<p>“No, she isn’t there, Vi! Maybe a tramp
has taken her!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Violet, in such a loud voice
that Mrs. Bunker, having heard part of the
talk, came quickly from the room where she
had been sewing.</p>

<p>“Who’s gone?” demanded the mother of the
six little Bunkers. “Don’t tell me Mun Bun
is lost again!”</p>

<p>Mun Bun was the youngest of the six little
Bunkers. His real name was Munroe Ford
Bunker, but that was entirely too long for the
little fellow, so he was called “Mun Bun.”
It was a name he had made up for himself.</p>

<p>“Where is Mun Bun? Is he lost again?”
asked Mrs. Bunker, starting to take off her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
apron to go in search of the “little tyke,” as
she often called him, for he certainly did get
into mischief very many times.</p>

<p>“Mun Bun isn’t lost,” answered Violet, as
she hurried out on the porch with Margy.
“He’s out in the yard with Laddie, digging
a hole.”</p>

<p>“An’ he says he’s going to dig down to
China,” added Margy.</p>

<p>“And I just put clean bloomers on him!”
sighed Mrs. Bunker. “But who is gone?”
she asked again. “It can’t be Rose or Russ—they’re
too old to be taken by a tramp!”</p>

<p>There, now you have heard the names of
all six of the little Bunkers, though Russ, being
nearly ten, I think, wouldn’t like to be
called “little.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t Russ or Rose,” said Margy.
“I saw them going down the street. Maybe
they’re going to daddy’s office to ask him for
some money to buy candy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they mustn’t do that!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bunker. “This is the first of the month and
daddy is very busy. They shouldn’t have
gone there. Are you sure, Margy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they didn’t zactly <em>say</em> they were going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
there,” announced Margy. “But I
thought maybe——”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t tell things you aren’t sure of,”
said her mother. “But who is——”</p>

<p>“Mother, why is daddy so busy the first of
the month?” asked Vi, forgetting for the moment
all about what she had sent Margy to
look for. Violet Bunker was, as her father
said, “a great girl for asking questions.” Her
mother knew this, and, fearing that Vi would
get started on a list of inquiries that would
take some time to answer, Mrs. Bunker
said:</p>

<p>“Now don’t begin that, Vi, dear. I’ll answer
just this one question, but not any more.
Your father is busy the first of the month more
than at other times because tenants pay their
rents then, and he collects the rents for a large
number of people. That’s one thing a real
estate dealer, like your father, does. Now,
don’t ask another question!” she commanded,
for she saw that Vi was getting ready, as Russ
would say, “to spring another.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to ask a question,” said Vi,
looking a little hurt in her feelings. “I was
going to say——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“Wait until I find out what’s happened
first,” broke in Mrs. Bunker. “Who is missing?
It can’t be any of you, for you’re all
present or accounted for, as they say in the
army. Who is——”</p>

<p>“It’s Esmeralda!” exclaimed Violet. “I
had her out on the porch playing with Margy.
Then we went in to look at the picture books,
and I forgot about Esmeralda and——”</p>

<p>“Russ says her name ought to be Measles
’cause she’s all spotted,” put in Margy, with
a shake of her dark, tousled hair. “But it’s
only spots of dirt.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” demanded Vi of Margy, taking
her younger sister by the hand. “We’ve got
to find Esmeralda!”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s your doll!” remarked Mrs.
Bunker, with a sigh of relief. “I thought
one of you children was missing. I had quite
a start. It’s only your doll. That’s different.”</p>

<p>“Esmeralda is my <em>child</em>, even if she is <em>only</em>
a <em>doll</em>,” and Vi marched away with Margy,
her head held up proudly.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, I didn’t mean that you
shouldn’t want to find your missing play
child,” called Mrs. Bunker quickly, for she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
realized that a little girl’s feelings might be
hurt by a slighting remark about even a dirty
and spotted doll. “I only meant that I was
glad none of you children was missing. I’ll
help you look for Esmeralda.”</p>

<p>“She isn’t out on the porch. I looked,”
said Margy.</p>

<p>“We left her there, didn’t we?” asked Vi,
for sometimes there was so much going on at
the Bunker house that to remember where one
of the many dolls or other playthings was left
became a task.</p>

<p>“Yes, we left Esmeralda out on the porch,”
agreed Margy. “But she isn’t there now. I
looked. She’s—she’s gone!”</p>

<p>Margy felt almost as sad over the loss as
did Vi, though Esmeralda, or “Measles,” as
Russ called her, belonged particularly to
Violet.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose a tramp would take my doll,
Mother?” asked Violet, for Mrs. Bunker was
now walking toward the side porch with her
two little girls.</p>

<p>“No, my dear, I don’t believe so,” was the
answer. “What would a tramp want with a
doll?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>This puzzled Vi for a moment, but she
quickly had ready a reply.</p>

<p>“He—he might want to give her to his little
girl,” Vi said.</p>

<p>“Tramps, as a rule, don’t have little girls,”
remarked Mrs. Bunker. “If they had they
wouldn’t be tramps.”</p>

<p>This gave Vi a chance to ask another question.
Eagerly she had it ready.</p>

<p>“Why don’t tramps have little girls?” she
inquired of her mother. “Do they run away?
I mean do the little girls run away?”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t the reason,” and Mrs.
Bunker tried not to smile at Vi’s eagerness.
“I’ll tell you about it some other time. But
show me where you left your doll,” she added,
as they reached the shady side porch. “Esmeralda
certainly isn’t here,” for a look
around showed no doll in sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, where can she be?” gasped Vi, now
on the verge of tears. Margy, seeing how her
sister was affected, was also getting ready to
weep, but just then a merry whistle was heard
around the corner of the house. It was the
merry whistle of a happy boy.</p>

<p>“Here comes Russ!” exclaimed Violet, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
she knew her oldest brother’s habit of being
tuneful. “He’ll help me look for Esmeralda.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he took her,” suggested Margy.</p>

<p>“No. If he did he wouldn’t be coming
back whistling,” decided Vi.</p>

<p>Russ Bunker, next to his father the “man”
of the family, swung around the path at the
side of the house. Following him was Rose,
his sister, a year younger, a pretty girl, with
light, fluffy hair. And, very often, Rose had
a merry song on her lips. But as Russ was
now whistling Rose could not sing. She always
said Russ whistled “out of tune,” but
Russ declared it was her singing that was off
key.</p>

<p>“Oh, Russ!” exclaimed his mother, “you
didn’t go to daddy’s office and bother him to-day,
did you, when it’s the first of the month?
And he is so busy——”</p>

<p>“No, Mother, I wasn’t at daddy’s office,”
Russ answered. “Rose and I just went to the
store for some nails. I’m making a seesaw,
and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, can I be on it?” begged Margy. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
love to teeter-totter! Please, Russ, can’t
I——”</p>

<p>“I want a ride, too!” put in Vi.</p>

<p>“All right! All right!” agreed Russ, with
a laugh. “You can all have rides—Mun Bun
and Laddie too—as soon as I get it made.
But it’s a lot of work and it’s got to be done
right and——”</p>

<p>Russ paused. He could see that something
was wrong, as he said afterward. Russ was
a quick thinker. Also he was always making
things about the house. These were mostly
things with which to play and have a good
time, though once he built a bench for his
mother. The only trouble was that he didn’t
make the legs strong enough, and when Norah
O’Grady, the cook, set a tub of water on the
bench the legs caved in and there was a “mess”
in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” asked Russ, for
he could see that his mother and his two small
sisters had come out on the porch with some
special idea in mind.</p>

<p>“Violet’s doll is gone,” explained Mrs.
Bunker. “She left it on the porch, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
feels sad over losing it. If you know anything
about it, Russ——”</p>

<p>“You mean that old Measles doll?” asked
the oldest Bunker boy, laughing.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t the measles at all—so there!”
and Violet stamped her foot on the porch.</p>

<p>“Well, she looks so—all spotted,” added
Russ, with another laugh. Then, as he saw
that Violet was ready to cry and that Margy
was going to follow with tears, Russ added:
“I guess I know where your doll is. Henry
Miller just told me——”</p>

<p>“Oh, did he take her?” cried Violet. “If he
did I’ll never speak to him again and——”</p>

<p>“Now, wait a minute!” advised Russ.
“You girls always get so excited! I didn’t
say Henry took your doll. I just met him
and he said he saw a dog running out of our
yard with something in his mouth. Maybe
it was the dog that took your doll, Violet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried the little girl, and she
was now sobbing in real earnest.</p>

<p>“Oh, the dog will eat up Esmeralda!” and
Margy added her tears to those of Violet.</p>

<p>“I’ll go down the street and look for her,”
quickly offered Russ. He was a kind boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
that way. Of course he didn’t care for dolls,
and he was anxious to start making the seesaw,
nails for which he and Rose had gone
after. But Russ was willing to give up his
own pleasure to help his little sister.</p>

<p>“I’ll get your doll,” he said. “I guess that
dog wouldn’t carry her far after he found out
she wasn’t a bone or something good to eat.”</p>

<p>“She—she—she’s a nice doll, anyhow, so
there!” sobbed Violet. “An’—an’ I—I want
her!”</p>

<p>“I guess I can find her,” offered Russ.
“Here, Rose, you hold the nails.”</p>

<p>Russ started on a run toward the front gate.
Mrs. Bunker and the three girls followed.
As yet Laddie and Mun Bun had not heard
the excitement over the missing doll, for they
were still in the back yard, “digging down to
China.”</p>

<p>Russ reached the gate, looked down the
road in the direction Henry Miller had told
him the dog had run with something in its
mouth, and then Russ cried:</p>

<p>“I see her! I see your doll, Vi! The dog
dropped her in the street! I’ll get her for
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>Russ started on the run toward a small object
lying in the dust of the road. Before
Russ could reach the doll a big automobile
truck swung around the corner and came
straight for poor Esmeralda.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’ll be run over!” screamed Violet.
“My child!”</p>

<p>But Russ had also seen the truck and, knowing
there would be little left of the doll if
one of the heavy wheels went over her, he
ran a little faster and darted directly in front
of the big lumbering, thundering automobile.</p>

<p>“Russ! Russ! Be careful!” called his
mother.</p>

<p>“Look out there, youngster!” yelled the man
who was driving the truck.</p>

<p>On came the heavy automobile, bearing
down on Russ who was now in the middle of
the street, stooping over to pick up Esmeralda.</p>

<span class="fs80">A LOAD OF FLOWERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Three of the six little Bunkers—Rose,
Margy and Violet—stood grouped around
their mother, looking with anxious eyes toward
Russ, who had made up his mind that
he was going to get Vi’s doll and snatch it
out of danger before the big truck reached
it. But, in doing this, Russ was also in danger
himself.</p>

<p>“Russ! Russ! Come back!” cried his
mother, darting forward.</p>

<p>“It’s going to run right over him!” screamed
Margy.</p>

<p>“He’ll be smashed!” and Violet covered her
eyes with her hands.</p>

<p>“Let the old doll go!” shouted Rose.</p>

<p>But Russ did not heed. Straight across the
street, directly in front of the truck he ran,
and toward Vi’s doll Esmeralda that was lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
in the highway, where she had been
dropped by the stray dog.</p>

<p>The man driving the big truck, after giving
one call of warning, had ceased, and was
now doing his best either to steer out of the
way, so he would not run over Russ, or else
to put on the brakes. This last was not so
easy to do as the street just there was down
hill and the truck was a heavy one.</p>

<p>Russ reached the doll before the truck got
to it. The Bunker boy picked up Vi’s plaything
and started to run out of danger, but
he slipped on a stone and down he fell in the
dust of the road.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried his mother. “Oh, Russ!”</p>

<p>Russ was down, but, as he said afterward,
he was not “out.” He rolled to one side, out
of the way of the thundering big wheels of
the truck. A moment later he was on his feet,
dirty and dusty, but holding proudly aloft the
doll he had rescued.</p>

<p>By this time the man had brought his truck
to a stop, a little distance from the place where
Russ had fallen and where the doll had been
lying.</p>

<p>“That was a narrow escape for you, youngster!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
exclaimed the man rather sternly.
“You ought not to do things like that!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want Vi’s doll run over,” explained
Russ, as his mother and sisters hurried
toward him.</p>

<p>And while Russ is brushing the dust from
his clothing and while Vi is looking over her
doll, to make sure it is all right, I shall take
a moment to let you know who the Bunkers
are. And I shall also speak of the other books
in this series telling about them. I think it
is much better to read about people after you
know who they are and what they have done.</p>

<p>The first book introducing the children is
called “Six Little Bunkers at Grandma
Bell’s.” At the opening of that story you find
the Bunkers living in Pineville, a Pennsylvania
town.</p>

<p>Bunker was the family name, and as there
were six children, none of them very large, it
was the most natural thing in the world to
speak of them as the “six little Bunkers.” Of
course there was a father and mother Bunker.
Mr. Bunker’s name was Charles, and he was
in the real estate business. His wife was
named Amy, and there were a number of relatives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
all of whom loved the six little Bunkers
and all of whom the six little Bunkers loved.</p>

<p>As for the children the eldest was Russ—the
one who was just in such danger. Russ
seemed destined to become an inventor, for
he was always making new things—make-believe
houses, engines, automobiles, steamboats
and the like. And as he worked he
whistled merrily.</p>

<p>Rose might be called a “little mother,” for
she was very helpful about the house, and
Mrs. Bunker often said:</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I’d do without Rose to
help look after the younger children.”</p>

<p>Violet and Laddie, who were twins, needed
much looking after. They were both rather
peculiar. That is, Violet was given to asking
questions. Her father said she could ask
more in an hour than could be rightly answered
in a week. As for Laddie, he was
fond of asking riddles such as:</p>

<p>“You can have a house full and a hole full
but you can’t keep a bowl full. What is it?”
The answer, of course, is “smoke,” but nothing
gave Laddie more pleasure than to find
some one who couldn’t answer that or some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
other riddle he asked. Sometimes he made
up riddles himself, or he might ask one that
came out of a book. A queer little chap was
Laddie.</p>

<p>Then there was Margy, who was seldom
called by her real name of Margaret, and
Mun Bun, otherwise known as Munroe Ford,
as I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Now you have met all the six little Bunkers
and I hope you will like them. As for their
aunts, their uncles, their cousins and their
other relatives—well, there are books telling
about these different characters. The children
often went to visit their cousins and
aunts and had many adventures.</p>

<p>For instance there is the time they stayed
for a while at Aunt Jo’s, or the occasion of
their visit to Cousin Tom’s. They had fun
at both these places, but no more than at
Grandpa Ford’s or Uncle Fred’s. When they
spent several weeks at Captain Ben’s the six
little Bunkers had delightful times, and Russ
thought there never was such a chap as Cowboy
Jack, at whose ranch they spent some time.
The other children liked Cowboy Jack, too.</p>

<p>Just before the events I am going to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
you about in this book took place, the children
had been down South. You may find
out all that happened by reading the volume,
“Six Little Bunkers at Mammy June’s.” The
family was now at home again in Pineville,
ready for more adventures.</p>

<p>“You certainly gave me a fright, boy,” said
the truck driver, as he got down off his high
seat and looked at Russ. “Why did you run
out into the road like that?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to get my sister’s doll,” answered
Russ, still brushing the dust from his clothes.</p>

<p>“Um! Well, don’t do it again—that’s all
I ask!” begged the man. “I was afraid I was
going to run right over you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a very dangerous thing for him
to do,” said Mrs. Bunker. “He shouldn’t
have tried it. I’m sorry he caused you
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t exactly trouble,” said the
man, and he smiled a little. “I was going to
stop around here, anyhow. I’m looking for
a family named Bunker. Do you know if
they live around here?”</p>

<p>“We’re the Bunkers!” quickly answered
Russ. “Anyhow, we’re the most of ’em,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
added, laughing. “All but daddy and——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured the driver of the truck.
“Are there more of you?”</p>

<p>“It is rather a large family,” said Mrs.
Bunker. “I have two more boys.”</p>

<p>“My daddy’s in his office,” volunteered Violet,
who was now satisfied that her doll, Esmeralda,
was all right except for a little dirt.</p>

<p>“And Laddie and Mun Bun are digging a
hole to China,” added Margy.</p>

<p>“Oh,” and again the man smiled.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for a Mr. Charles
Bunker?” asked Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“That’s the name, yes, ma’am,” the truck
driver replied, glancing at a slip of paper in
his hand. “I have a load of flowers for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, flowers! Is that what’s on your
auto?” cried Rose, for the sides of the truck
were covered with canvas and it could not be
seen what it was laden with. Without waiting
for an answer, Rose hurried around to
the rear. There she saw a number of pots of
flowers and plants, and, being very fond of
them, she reached up to pull nearer to her the
pot closest to the end of the truck.</p>

<p>Perhaps the sudden stopping of the vehicle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
had made the pot unsteady, for, as Rose
touched it, the pot was upset and rolled out
of the truck toward the little girl.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried Rose.</p>

<p>“What is the matter now?” asked Mrs.
Bunker, going around to the rear of the truck.
She was just in time to see a shower of brown
earth from the pot splattering around Rose.
The pot fell to the ground and was broken,
the flower in it being knocked out.</p>

<p>“Not much damage done as long as the little
girl isn’t harmed,” said the driver. “I’ve
got some extra pots on the truck and I can
easily plant this flower again,” and he picked
up the geranium, which was a pink one in full
blossom.</p>

<p>“Let me ’mell!” begged Mun Bun who,
with Laddie, had now come out in the street
to see why his mother and the other little
Bunkers were gathered there.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much smell to that geranium,”
laughed the driver. “But I have other flowers
that do smell.”</p>

<p>“Are all these for us?” asked Mrs. Bunker,
as she saw the mass of blossoms inside. “Rose,
dear, are you sure you aren’t hurt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Mother, I’m all right,” was the answer.
“But, oh, where did all the pretty
flowers come from?”</p>

<p>“They’re from Mr. Joel Todd,” answered
the driver.</p>

<p>“Farmer Joel?” asked Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Yes, some folks call him that,” was the reply,
and Mrs. Bunker remembered a rather
odd character whom her husband knew. Mr.
Bunker had often spoken of “Farmer Joel,”
but had said nothing about a load of flowers
coming from him.</p>

<p>“Did my husband order these?” asked Mrs.
Bunker.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know that he did, exactly,”
the driver answered. “Farmer Joel had more
plants than he could use, so he told me to
bring these in to you, as I had to come this
way anyhow with a load of produce.”</p>

<p>“Mother, who is Farmer Joel?” asked Rose,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>“He has a farm about forty miles from
here,” answered Mrs. Bunker. “Your father
and I were there some years ago. Farmer
Joel has orchards, bees, flowers, chickens,
cows, and horses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, what a lovely place that would be to
go to for the rest of the summer!” exclaimed
Rose.</p>

<p>“Could we go there, Mother?” begged Vi.</p>

<p>“I—now—I know a riddle about a horse,”
spoke up Laddie. “When is a boy a little
horse?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t time for riddles now, dear,”
said his mother. “I must tell this man where
to leave the flowers that Farmer Joel was so
kind as to send us.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I’ll tell you when a boy is a
little horse,” went on Laddie. “It’s when he
has a cold.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Being <em>hoarse</em> when you have a cold
isn’t being a <em>horse</em> on a farm,” declared Rose.</p>

<p>“It’s good enough for a riddle,” replied
Laddie. “Oh, I want a ride!” he cried, as
he saw the driver climbing up on his seat after
Mrs. Bunker had pointed out her house.</p>

<p>“No, Laddie! Keep off the truck,” his
mother warned him.</p>

<p>“Farmer Joel!” said Russ, in a musing tone
as they all turned to go back home. “I wonder
if we could go there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll have the chance,” his mother
said, smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” cried the six little Bunkers
in delight.</p>

<p>“But I can’t tell you any more now,” Mrs.
Bunker went on. “It’s a secret!”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SECRET</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Bunker could not have said anything
more exciting than the word “secret” if she
had tried for a week. Hearing it, the six
little Bunkers fairly jumped for joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! A secret!” cried Russ.</p>

<p>“Let me guess what it is!” begged Laddie,
acting as though he thought it a riddle.</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me!” cried Rose. “I won’t tell
the others, Mother.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” laughed Mrs. Bunker. “When
it is time to tell the secret you shall all know
it at once.”</p>

<p>“Is it about us?” asked Violet, with what
she thought a cunning air, hoping she might
surprise something of the secret from her
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s about all of you,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Is it good to eat?” was what Mun Bun
wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, the secret is good to eat,” answered
Mrs. Bunker, with laughing eyes, as she looked
at Farmer Joel’s truck driver.</p>

<p>“Is it good to play with?” was the question
Margy asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s good to play with, too,” said her
mother.</p>

<p>This set all the six little Bunkers to guessing,
and they named first one thing and then
another, but Mrs. Bunker only shook her head,
laughed, and told them they would have to
wait to find out about the secret.</p>

<p>“You’ve got your hands full with those
youngsters, I can see that,” chuckled the truck
driver, who had said his name was Adam
North. “They must keep you busy.”</p>

<p>“They do. But they are good children,”
Mrs. Bunker said, while Rose was murmuring:</p>

<p>“I can’t think what kind of a secret it can
be that you can eat and play with. Can you,
Russ?”</p>

<p>“Not unless it’s a candy cane—the kind we
used to get for Christmas,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, it couldn’t be <em>that</em>!” quickly declared
Rose. “Mother wouldn’t make a secret about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
a candy cane. I think it must have something
to do with this Farmer Joel.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Russ. “But I have to go
into the house and brush my clothes. I didn’t
think they were so dusty. It’s like sliding for
first base when you’re playing ball.”</p>

<p>By this time the six little Bunkers in charge
of their mother were ready to walk back toward
their house. They made a pretty picture
as they stood in the street, Mun Bun and
Margy were first, side by side, and holding
hands as the two youngest generally did.
Then came the twins, Violet and Laddie, next
largest in size, and back of them were Rose
and Russ, while Mrs. Bunker came behind
the two oldest, smiling at her “brood,” as she
sometimes called them, pretending they were
hungry chickens.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re generally hungry all right,”
Russ would say with a laugh when his mother
spoke thus.</p>

<p>“I suppose we look like a procession, don’t
we?” asked Mrs. Bunker of Adam North, as
he prepared to start his truckload of flowers.</p>

<p>“Well, a little, yes,” he agreed, with a
laugh. “But it’s a mighty nice procession. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
guess Farmer Joel wishes he had one like it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, he has no children, has he?” remarked
Mrs. Bunker. “It’s been some time
since I have seen him, and I thought perhaps
he might have married.”</p>

<p>“No,” went on Mr. North, while the six
little Bunkers listened to the talk, wondering,
the while, what the wonderful secret might
be. “Farmer Joel is still a bachelor. He
lives with his sister Miss Lavina. She keeps
house for him, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know Lavina Todd very well,”
said Mrs. Bunker. “She and I were old
chums. We went to school together when we
lived in the same country town as girls. But
that was quite a number of years ago, and I
thought Farmer Joel might have married in
all that time.”</p>

<p>“No—old bachelor,” replied Adam North.
“But he’s the kindest, jolliest soul you’d want
to meet and he loves children. That’s why I
say he’d like a procession like yours. Now
then, where do you want these flowers? I’ve
got quite a load of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Indeed you have a wonderful load of
blossoms,” said Mrs. Bunker. “It was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
kind of Farmer Joel to send them. But I’m
afraid I can’t set them out all alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll stay and help you plant the flowers,”
offered Adam North, who was something
of a farmer and gardener himself. “Mr.
Todd said I was to do that. I’ve got to stay,
anyhow, to see Mr. Bunker. He’ll be home
soon, I expect.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’ll come home to supper,” replied
Mrs. Bunker. “I hope you can stay and have
a meal with us,” she added.</p>

<p>“Well, I might—yes,” was the slow answer.
“In fact, I was going to stay over at the hotel
all night, as it’s a long ride back to Cedarhurst,
and I don’t like to drive the truck after
dark if I can help it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you can stay at our house,”
quickly said Mrs. Bunker. “We’d be delighted
to have you. There is plenty of
room.”</p>

<p>“And you can tell us about the farm,” added
Rose.</p>

<p>“And about the bees,” added Mun Bun.
“Does they sting?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” laughed Mr. North.</p>

<br>

<p>“And tell us about the cows and chickens,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>begged Laddie. “I know a riddle about—now—about
a cow, only I can’t think of it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the cow that jumped over the
moon,” joked Mr. North.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that,” Laddie answered.
“Maybe I’ll think of it after a while.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear about the horses,” suggested
Violet. “How many horses does
Farmer Joel have and do they ever run away
and did they ever run away with you and did
you get hurt and are there any little horses?
I don’t believe they’d run away, would they?
And if a horse runs away does he run back
again and——”</p>

<p>“Violet! Violet!” cried her mother. But
the little girl had stopped herself, for she was
out of breath.</p>

<p>“Does she often get spells like that?” asked
Adam North, with a laughing look at Mrs.
Bunker.</p>

<p>“Sometimes,” was the smiling answer.
“But generally she asks her questions one at
a time. I don’t know what made her take
such a streak. But come, children, I want to
get these flowers set out before daddy comes
home. Come along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“We can plant some in the hole we dug,”
said Laddie.</p>

<p>“No! No!” cried Mun Bun. “That’s a
hole to China and we don’t want any flowers
in it!”</p>

<p>“Easy, Mun Bun! Don’t get so excited,”
soothed Russ. “Maybe the people in China
would like some of these flowers.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. I give some flowers to
Chiweeze,” agreed Mun Bun.</p>

<p>By this time the truck had rolled into the
driveway of the Bunker home, and the family
of children and their mother soon followed.
The doll, which had been the cause
of so much excitement, and not a little trouble,
was put in the house where no wandering
dog could carry her off again. Then
Adam North began unloading the pots of
flowers, some of which needed to be set out in
the ground to make them grow better.</p>

<p>It was toward the end of spring, with summer
in prospect and just the time to start
making a flower garden, Mr. North said.
Farmer Joel raised many kinds of plants and
blossoms, his sister Miss Lavina Todd helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
him. They had so many that it had been
decided to send some to Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“But I never thought he could spare all
these,” remarked Mrs. Bunker, when she saw
the geraniums, the begonias, the four-o’clocks,
the petunias, the zinnias, the marigolds and
many other kinds of “posy-trees,” as Mun Bun
called them.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we have more flowers at Cedarhurst
than we know what to do with,” said
Adam North, as he began setting out the blossoms.</p>

<p>The children and Mrs. Bunker helped as
much as they could, but except for what Russ,
Rose and Mrs. Bunker did there was really
not much help. For Violet, Margy, Mun
Bun and Laddie would start to dig a hole in
which to set out a plant, then they would forget
all about it in running to see a new kind
of blossom that was taken from the truck.</p>

<p>So it was that there were a number of half-dug
holes about the garden, with nothing
planted in them. But Adam North knew his
business well, and soon he had turned the formerly
dull Bunker yard into a veritable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
flower-show, with bright blossoms here and
there.</p>

<p>“Now if you’ll just give ’em a little wetting
down with the hose so they won’t wilt, they’ll
come up fresh and strong by morning,” he
said, when the last plant was set out.</p>

<p>“I’ll use the hose!” offered Russ.</p>

<p>“I’ll help!” said Rose.</p>

<p>“So will I!” cried the other four little
Bunkers. Using the hose was something they
all delighted to do.</p>

<p>“No, my dears,” said Mrs. Bunker firmly.
“Russ will do the sprinkling and all the others
must come in and get washed ready for supper.
Daddy will soon be home and then——”</p>

<p>“Will you tell us the secret?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“I think so—yes,” was the reply, and this
gave the smaller children something to think
about so they did not mind not being allowed
to use the hose.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t dare let them take turns wetting
the new plants,” said Mrs. Bunker to
Adam. “Russ is all right, but the others
would shower every one passing in the street.”</p>

<p>“I reckon so, and wash out all the new
plants besides,” chuckled Farmer Joel’s hired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
man. “And now,” he went on, “since you
have been so kind as to ask me to stay to supper
and remain all night, I’d like to wash up
myself. I’m pretty dirty,” he added, with a
laugh, as he looked at his grimy hands, for
he had been delving in the dirt to set out the
flowers.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said Mrs. Bunker. “And,
Russ,” she added, “be careful about the hose.
Don’t spray on any people who may be passing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” he promised.</p>

<p>Ordinarily when Russ used the hose all the
other little Bunkers stood around anxiously
waiting for their turn. But now, with the
prospect of hearing a secret, they went willingly
to the bathroom and soon were as shining
as soap and water could make them.</p>

<p>Adam, as the children soon began to call
him, for he was very friendly, ran the big
truck up alongside the garage, as there was
not room for it inside. Then, after he had
washed and prepared for supper, he went out
to see that Russ did not spray too much water
on the newly set out plants.</p>

<p>Norah, the cook, had supper almost ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and Adam had told Russ enough water had
been used when the boy, looking down the
street, saw his father approaching.</p>

<p>“Here comes daddy!” he cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Bunker waved his newspaper and as
he reached the gate and saw the visitor a
pleasant smile came over his face and he
cried:</p>

<p>“Well, Adam North! Glad to see you!
How’s Farmer Joel?”</p>

<p>“Right hearty! I brought you those
flowers.”</p>

<p>“That’s good! Hello, Russ! How’s everything
here?”</p>

<p>“All right, Daddy!”</p>

<p>“Daddy! Daddy!” came in a chorus from
the other little Bunkers, and their father was
overwhelmed in a joyous rush.</p>

<p>“What’s the secret?”</p>

<p>“Tell us the secret!”</p>

<p>“Can Mother tell us the secret now?”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the words Mr.
Bunker heard as he was hugged and kissed.</p>

<p>“Secret?” he exclaimed, looking at Adam.
“What secret?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you know!” laughed Rose. “It must
be about Farmer Joel!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” chuckled Mr. Bunker. “Yes,
the secret is about him,” he admitted. “But
how did you all know it?”</p>

<p>“There’s been a lot of excitement in the last
hour,” said Adam. “I nearly ran over a doll,
just missed smashing Russ, and there’s a secret
in the air. Oh, nobody’s hurt,” he
quickly added, for he saw that Mr. Bunker
looked a little alarmed at the mention of what
had so nearly been an accident.</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Daddy Bunker.</p>

<p>“The secret! The secret!” begged the
children.</p>

<p>“All right. Come into the house and I’ll
tell you the secret,” he promised.</p>

<p>With whoops of delight, in trooped the six
little Bunkers.</p>

</div>

<p>“Supper is all ready, Daddy! We’ll sit
right down,” called Mother Bunker, as the
happy crowd entered. “I see you have already
met Farmer Joel’s man,” she added,
nodding and smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Adam and I are old friends,” Mr.
Bunker said. “And I’m glad supper is ready,
for I’m hungry. Let me see now——”</p>

<p>“The secret! The secret!”</p>

<p>“You promised to tell us the secret!”</p>

<p>“Tell us now!”</p>

<p>“Don’t wait until after supper!”</p>

<p>Thus cried the six little Bunkers.</p>

<p>“Quiet, children! Please be quiet!” begged
their mother. “What will Adam North think
of you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let ’em go on! I like it!” chuckled
the truck driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“I think perhaps I had better tell the secret,”
said Mr. Bunker. “It is the only way
we shall have any peace and quiet. Now all
of you sit down to the table,” he ordered, “and
when you can compose yourselves I will tell
you what I have to say.”</p>

<p>It took some little time for all of the six
little Bunkers to get quiet, but finally each one
was sitting nicely in his or her chair, with
their father at one end of the table and their
mother at the other, Adam having a place next
to Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mr. Bunker, when all was
quiet, “in order that you will not eat too fast,
to get through supper quickly to hear the secret,
I am going to tell it to you now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can hardly wait!” murmured Rose.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Violet.</p>

<p>Then came a moment of eager, anxious
waiting.</p>

<p>“We are all going to spend the summer at
Farmer Joel’s,” said Mr. Bunker suddenly.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” came the murmurs of
delight. Mrs. Bunker, with laughter shining
in her eyes, looked at the happy faces around
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“They sure will have fun out there!” said
Adam.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean it?” asked Russ.
“Are we going?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said his father. “Farmer Joel’s
sister, who has been keeping house for him,
is going away on a visit. When he told me
this he said he didn’t know what he was going
to do, as he didn’t want a strange woman
coming in to look after the place. Then I
said I would bring my six little Bunkers
up there and they would keep house for
him.”</p>

<p>“Did you really say that, Daddy?” Rose
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“I surely did.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can keep house a little bit,” Rose
went on. “But to cook for a farmer——”</p>

<p>Rose began to look worried, so her mother
said:</p>

<p>“You won’t have to do it all alone. I am
going with you, and so is Norah, and we’ll
see that Farmer Joel doesn’t get hungry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if mother is coming it will be all
right,” said Violet.</p>

<p>“Fine! Yes!” cried the other little Bunkers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
You can see they thought a great deal
of their mother.</p>

<p>“So that is how it came about,” went on
Mr. Bunker. “Farmer Joel’s sister is going
away on a long visit—to remain all summer.
We are going up there to live on his farm.”</p>

<p>“And can I help get in the crops?” asked
Russ, who liked to be busy.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll all help,” his father promised.
“I think you need a lot of help on a farm in
summer, don’t you, Adam?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” answered Farmer Joel’s
hired man. “The more help we have the better.
I’m pretty well rushed myself in the
summer.”</p>

<p>“And can we see the horses?” asked Violet.</p>

<p>“And the cows?” came from Laddie.</p>

<p>“And the sheep?” Mun Bun wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“And the apple trees?” asked Margy.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see the bees make honey,” remarked
Rose, who, herself, was often as busy
as any bee.</p>

<p>“You shall see everything there is to see,”
promised Daddy Bunker. “There! Now
you know the secret. We are going off to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Farmer Joel’s for the summer, and I think
we shall have a fine time. Now eat your
suppers!”</p>

<p>And the six little Bunkers did.</p>

<p>After supper there was more talk about going
to the farm, and Mr. Bunker said:</p>

<p>“I have been talking with Adam, and this
seems the best way to go. Cedarhurst, where
Farmer Joel lives, is about forty miles from
here. It is not on any railroad, so we shall
need to go in the automobile. As our car is
hardly large enough to take us all and the
trunks we shall need this is what we can do.</p>

<p>“Adam and I will ride to Cedarhurst in
the big auto truck that brought the flowers.
In that we can also take the baggage—the
trunks of clothes and the like. The children
can also ride in the truck with me. We’ll fill
it full of straw.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be fun!” cried Russ.</p>

<p>“A regular straw ride!” added Rose.</p>

<p>“But what about mother?” asked Violet.
“Is she going in the truck with us?”</p>

<p>“Your mother and Norah will drive up in
our own touring car,” said Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“When can we go?” asked Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“In a few days,” his father answered.</p>

<p>“Then I won’t bother to make the seesaw
here,” went on Russ. “I’ll save the nails and
take them to Farmer Joel’s.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” agreed Rose. “We
can make a lovely teeter-totter up there, and
have lots of fun.”</p>

<p>In the early evening, after supper, not much
was talked of by the six little Bunkers but the
coming visit to Farmer Joel’s. Mrs. Bunker,
who had been to the farm some years before
with her husband, told the children about it.
There were many places where they could
have fun, she said.</p>

<p>The evening was passing. Mun Bun and
Margy, in spite of their hard work to keep
awake, were fast falling asleep, their little
heads nodding from side to side and their eyes
closing.</p>

<p>“It’s time they were in bed!” cried Mrs.
Bunker, when she finally noticed them. “It’s
long past their hour. And Laddie and Vi,
too! They must go to bed!”</p>

<p>“I’ll carry up Mun Bun,” offered Mr.
Bunker.</p>

<p>“And I’ll take Margy,” said Adam, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
both the smallest children were now asleep.</p>

<p>“Come, Vi,” suggested her mother. “You
and Laddie can go up by yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Laddie isn’t here,” said Violet.</p>

<p>“He isn’t? Where is he?” asked her
mother. “Perhaps he has fallen asleep in a
corner of the porch,” for they were sitting
out on the piazza talking over the coming visit
to Farmer Joel’s.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t here,” went on Violet. “He
got up and walked off a little while ago.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess he went up to bed by himself,”
said Mr. Bunker, as he went into the
house carrying Mun Bun, while Adam followed
with Margy. “I’ll see if he’s in his
room,” he added to his wife.</p>

<p>But a little later, when Mr. Bunker called
down: “Laddie isn’t up here!” there was
some excitement.</p>

<p>“Where can he be?” asked Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s out in the yard trying to catch
lightning bugs,” suggested Rose, for she and
Russ were to be allowed to remain up a little
later than the smaller children.</p>

<p>“It’s too early for lightning bugs,” replied
Mrs. Bunker. “Where can the child have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
gone? Laddie! Laddie!” she called, raising
her voice. “Where are you?”</p>

<p>But the only sound was the singing of the
frogs down in the pond—that is, if you call
the noise the frogs make “singing.” There
was no answer from Laddie.</p>

<p>“He may have wandered down into the garden,
to look at some of the flowers you set
out,” suggested Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“He couldn’t see flowers in the dark,” objected
Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“He might if he took a flashlight,” said
Russ. “Maybe that’s what he did. I’ll go
and look for him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come and help you,” offered Adam.</p>

<p>But a search through the garden and more
calling of Laddie’s name brought no answer
from the little fellow.</p>

<p>“Where can he have gone?” exclaimed Mrs.
Bunker. “I’m afraid he’s lost.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="fs80">OFF TO THE FARM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bunker saw that his wife was growing
a little alarmed over Laddie’s absence, so
he said:</p>

<p>“Now don’t worry, we’ll find Laddie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you look for him,” said Adam.
“He can’t have gone very far.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he fell asleep in the summer-house,”
suggested Russ, for at the end of the
garden was a rustic summer-house, or pavilion,
in which the children sometimes
played. But Laddie was not there.</p>

<p>“Could he have fallen into the brook?”
asked Rose.</p>

<p>“If he did, all that could happen would be
that he got wet,” her father answered, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“And if Laddie fell into the brook I guess
he’d yell and we would hear him,” Rose said,
nodding her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“’Tisn’t very deep, anyhow,” added Russ.</p>

<p>They looked farther in the garden for
Laddie and called his name, but there was no
answer. Mr. Bunker was just beginning to
get worried when the telephone in the house
suddenly rang.</p>

<p>“Maybe that’s some news of him!” exclaimed
the mother of the missing little fellow.
She started toward the telephone, but Laddie’s
father reached it first.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hello!” called Mr. Bunker into
the telephone.</p>

<p>The others listened to what he had to say.</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes,” he went on. “Oh, then he’s all
right. I’m glad of that. Thank you! Yes,
I’ll be right down after him.”</p>

<p>“Evidently it’s about Laddie?” said Mrs.
Bunker in a questioning voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered her husband, as he hung
up the receiver. “Laddie is in the police
station.”</p>

<p>“The <em>police station</em>!” cried Russ.</p>

<p>“Is he arrested? What for?” Rose queried
wonderingly.</p>

<p>Daddy Bunker laughed, which let them all
know it could not be very serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“What is it?” asked his wife.</p>

<p>“As nearly as I can make out,” said Mr.
Bunker, “Laddie wandered away from here
and went to the police station about some
riddle.”</p>

<p>“A <em>riddle</em>!” cried Adam North. “Good
gasoline! That boy must dream of riddles!”</p>

<p>“I sometimes think he does,” sighed his
mother. “But what sort of riddle is it this
time?” she asked her husband.</p>

<p>“The officer at the police station didn’t just
know,” was Mr. Bunker’s answer. “He said
they had Laddie there and asked me to come
and get him, as they didn’t want to send him
home with a policeman for fear the neighbors
would think something had happened. As
nearly as I can make out, Laddie must have
thought of a riddle and have gone to the police
station to see if any one could guess
it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he ask one of us?” his mother
wanted to know. “He generally does ask us
first.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out all about it when I bring
him home,” replied Mr. Bunker. “I’ll go
right after him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Will you take the car?” asked Mrs.
Bunker.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think I’d better. Laddie may have
fallen asleep, and he’s pretty heavy to carry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” offered Adam, and soon
they were at the police station.</p>

<p>There they found Laddie wide awake, sitting
in the assembly room of the station house,
while several officers, who were on reserve
duty, were laughing and joking with him.</p>

<p>“He’s far from being asleep,” said Mr.
North.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” agreed Mr. Bunker.
“Laddie boy, what in the world are you doing
down here?” he asked the little fellow.</p>

<p>“I came down to find out about a riddle,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“And he’s had us all guessing riddles ever
since he walked in here about an hour ago,”
chuckled the police sergeant in charge of the
station. “He’s a great boy!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t perzactly come down here to ask
riddles,” said Laddie. “But I wanted to make
up a riddle about a policeman to ask Farmer
Joel when I got to the farm, and I had to see
a police station inside to make up the riddle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“Well, did you make the riddle up?” asked
the sergeant, with another laugh. Life at the
station was very often dull, and the men on
duty welcomed any little change.</p>

<p>“Yes, I got a riddle,” Laddie announced.
“’Tisn’t very good, but maybe I can think of
a better one after a while. This is it. Why is
a police station like a candy shop?”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed the sergeant. “That
may be a riddle, but I can’t see it. Nothing
could be more different than a candy store and
this police station.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s something alike in each of
them,” went on Laddie. “Do you all give
up?” he asked. “Can you tell why a police
station is like a candy shop?”</p>

<p>“Is it because when people are brought here
they have to stick?” asked Adam.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! That’s pretty good!” laughed
the sergeant. “I’d never think of that myself!
Pretty good! A police station is like a candy
shop because people have to stick here! And
it’s true! They do have to stick if we arrest
them and put them in a cell. And if there’s
sticky candy on the floor of a candy shop
they’d stick there. Pretty good!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“No, that isn’t the reason,” said Laddie.
“Listen. I’ll tell you. A police station is like
a candy shop because it’s full of sticks. Sticks,
you know—the policemen’s clubs. They’re
like sticks of candy, you know!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed the sergeant again.
“That’s pretty good! I must remember that
to tell the captain. Well, good night to you,”
he added, as Mr. Bunker led Laddie out,
thanking the sergeant and his men for having
entertained and kept the little boy.</p>

<p>On the way home in the automobile Mr.
Bunker said Laddie should not have slipped
off and gone down the street to the police station
without telling some one about it.</p>

<p>“We were all worried, Laddie,” went on
his father.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” the little fellow said. “I won’t
do it again. But I got to thinking I could
make up a good riddle about a policeman, and
I thought it would be better if I could see
one before I made the riddle, so I just
went.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a pretty good riddle—I’ll say
that,” chuckled Adam North. “Maybe you
can make up some about the farm when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
get there. Farmer Joel likes jokes and
riddles.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make up a lot of them for him,” kindly
offered Laddie, as if he had a stock of riddles
constantly on hand and could turn them out
at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p>“Oh, Laddie, you bad boy, where have you
been?” asked his mother when he reached
home.</p>

<p>When they told her his riddle about the
police station and candy shop, she could not
help laughing.</p>

<p>A few days after this everything was ready
for the start to Farmer Joel’s. Mr. Bunker
had arranged to leave his real estate business
in charge of his men at the office, and Mrs.
Bunker prepared to close the house, taking
Norah with her to cook at the farm.</p>

<p>The children’s clothing had been packed in
valises and trunks, and piled in the big auto
truck which was filled with straw to make a
comfortable resting place for the six little
Bunkers on their forty-mile trip.</p>

<p>As I have told you, the children and their
father would ride in the big truck with Adam,
and Mrs. Bunker would follow with Norah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
in the touring car, the children’s mother doing
the driving.</p>

<p>All was one grand excitement in the home
of the six little Bunkers when the morning
came on which they were to leave for the
farm. Every one seemed to be talking at
once, and certainly the children, Violet especially,
never seemed to have asked so many
questions before.</p>

<p>Laddie, too, was on the alert. He was
working on a new riddle. He spoke of it to
Russ.</p>

<p>“It’s about a tree,” said Laddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know that old riddle,” Russ said.
“You mean why is a tree like a dog? Because
it has a bark.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that one,” Laddie said eagerly.
“This is a new riddle. Now I have it!
What’s the difference between a tree and a
bird? Can you answer that?”</p>

<p>“Let me see now,” murmured Russ, who
wanted to please his little brother. “The difference
between a bird and a tree. Well, one
flies and the other doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“Nope!” cried Laddie. “I’ll tell you. A
tree leaves in the spring and a bird leaves in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the fall. See what I mean? A tree leaves in
the spring—the leaves come out. But a bird
leaves in the fall. The bird leaves the North
and flies down South where it’s warm.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that’s a very good riddle,”
said Russ.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I can think of a better one
after a while,” Laddie remarked cheerfully.
He certainly was good-natured.</p>

<p>Now that the time of going to the farm had
arrived, Violet was eager to find out all about
the animals. She fairly pestered Adam with
wanting to know things. She asked:</p>

<p>“How many chickens are there? How
many cows? Did you ever count the bees?”</p>

<p>“Count the bees? Good land, no!” laughed
Adam. “There’s millions of ’em and they
never keep still long enough to be counted.
Besides, if I tried they might sting me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Vi, “are there any——”</p>

<p>“Violet, get in the truck and sit still,” ordered
her mother firmly, and Violet obeyed.</p>

<p>Everything was ready for the start. Mr.
Bunker was counting the children and the
trunks and the satchels, to make sure none was
missing, when Rose asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Where’s Margy?”</p>

<p>“Here she comes,” said Russ, as he noticed
his little sister appearing around the corner of
the house.</p>

<p>“What in the world is she carrying?” asked
Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>And well might he inquire. For Margy
was half dragging half carrying a large pasteboard
box which seemed alive, for it swayed
from side to side and seemed about to leap
away.</p>

<p>“Margy, what have you there?” called her
father.</p>

<p>Before she could answer the box gave a sudden
lurch to one side, Margy lost her balance,
and down she went on the path in a heap, the
box tumbling over and over as if it had suddenly
come to life. What could it be?</p>

<span class="fs80">SOMETHING IN THE STRAW</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Five little Bunkers, with their father, their
mother, Norah, and Adam North looked at
one little Bunker in a queer plight. That one
little Bunker was Margy.</p>

<p>After her fall Margy rolled along the path
a short distance, for she was a round little girl,
quite chubby and, as her father often said,
“about as broad as she was long.”</p>

<p>As Margy rolled along, the box she had
been carrying also rolled.</p>

<p>There was nothing very strange in Margy’s
rolling over and over after a tumble. She
often did that. So did the other little Bunkers.
So, also, do you if you are little and fat.</p>

<p>There was also nothing very strange in the
box, which Margy had been carrying, rolling
over. That is, there would not have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
anything strange if the box had just rolled
in one direction.</p>

<p>But it did not. It rolled this way and that
way and the other way and then it rolled this
way again, in such a strange manner that Russ
cried:</p>

<p>“What in the world can be in that box to
make it go that way?”</p>

<p>“It’s just as if it was alive!” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a riddle!” suggested Laddie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker had gone to Margy to pick
her up. Beyond a scratch or two and some
bruises, together with some dust on her dress,
Margy was unharmed. She was used to cuts
and bruises, so these did not much matter.
Nor did the dust.</p>

<p>Russ ran to pick up the queer, rolling box,
calling out:</p>

<p>“What’s in it, Margy?”</p>

<p>Before she could answer there came from
within the box, the cover of which was fitted
tightly on, a little yipping whine and bark.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a dog!” cried Mun Bun. “I want
to see the dog!”</p>

<p>“Dog!” exclaimed Violet. “It must be a
terribly little dog to be in a box like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Margy, what have you in the box?” asked
her father, as Russ was trying to take off the
cover.</p>

<p>“It’s a—now—a puppy!” answered Margy.</p>

<p>“A puppy!” cried the other five little Bunkers,
while Margy’s mother asked:</p>

<p>“Where did you get the puppy, Margy?”</p>

<p>“I went over to Tommy Baker’s house. His
dog has some little puppies, and I took one
and put it in this box ’cause I want to take a
puppy with me to the farm,” Margy
answered.</p>

<p>The others laughed.</p>

<p>By this time Russ had managed to get the
cover off the box, and a cute little puppy stuck
his head out, and, with his tongue, began licking
Russ’s hands. I suppose that was the
puppy’s way of telling how glad he was to get
out of the box.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he sweet!” cried Rose.</p>

<p>“Could we keep him?” begged Violet.</p>

<p>“I love him an’ he’s my puppy!” announced
Margy.</p>

<p>“Well, the next time you love a puppy don’t
shut him up in a box without any air, and
don’t drop him so the box rolls and he turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
somersaults,” advised Daddy Bunker. “Russ,
you run back to Mr. Baker’s with the little
dog, and tell him Margy didn’t really mean
to take it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy! can’t I keep it?” begged
Margy.</p>

<p>“No, dear. It belongs to Tommy Baker.
You’ll find animals enough out at Farmer
Joel’s, anyway,” said her mother, as Russ
started back with the puppy in his arms.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if Margy would
cry, but Mun Bun kept her tears back by
saying:</p>

<p>“It was awful funny when he did roll over
and over in the box. I like a puppy to do
that!” And when the others laughed at Mun
Bun’s funny way of saying this, Margy also
laughed.</p>

<p>Russ came running back, having left the
puppy with the others, a last look was taken
around the house to see that all was in good
order, and then Mrs. Bunker and Norah
started off in the touring car and Daddy and
Adam North started in the big straw-filled
truck with the six little Bunkers.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is great! It’s going to be lots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
fun!” exclaimed Russ, as they rumbled along.</p>

<p>“I hope there’s a big, old-fashioned kitchen
at Farmer Joel’s,” said Rose. “Mother said
I might help her with the baking of cake and
pies.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll help with the eating,” laughed
Russ. “I hope there’s a brook on the farm.
I want to make a water wheel and build a little
toy mill that the water wheel will turn.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” offered Laddie, as Russ
whistled merrily.</p>

<p>The way to Cedarhurst where Farmer Joel
lived was along a pleasant road, and the children,
sitting on the straw in the big truck,
enjoyed looking out through openings in the
canvas sides.</p>

<p>“Did we bring anything to eat?” asked Vi,
after a few miles had been journeyed.</p>

<p>“No, daddy said we were going to stop in
Westfield for our lunch,” explained Rose.
“We are going to meet mother there and all
eat together in a restaurant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” declared Vi.</p>

<p>“It would be more fun if we could camp
beside the road, make a fire and cook something,”
suggested Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“If I had a gun I could shoot something
and we could cook that,” cried Laddie.</p>

<p>“Pooh! What could you shoot? A bear?”
asked his twin sister.</p>

<p>“No,” he drawled. “But maybe I could
shoot a chicken.”</p>

<p>“If you did the farmer that owned it would
have you arrested,” declared Russ. “I guess
it will be better for us to eat in the restaurant.”</p>

<p>Adam North, who sat up in the front seat
with Daddy Bunker, suddenly turned the
truck off to one side of the road and brought
the big machine to a stop.</p>

<p>“Oh, are we there already?” cried Rose,
leaping up from the straw where she had been
sitting beside Russ.</p>

<p>“Are we at Farmer Joel’s?” asked Violet
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I want to wide on a horsie!” demanded
Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“No, we aren’t there yet,” answered Adam.
“But I need some water in the radiator of the
auto, so I’ll just stop here and get some.
There’s a farmer here whom I know.”</p>

<p>“May we get out?” asked Russ, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
thought perhaps they might not stop long
enough for this.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, get out and stretch your legs,” his
father told him.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait here five or ten minutes and cool
down the engine,” added Adam.</p>

<p>With whoops and shouts of delight the six
little Bunkers piled out of the truck and ran
up and down the road. The machine had
come to a stop with the open rear end close
to a wooden platform, which was just as high
as the floor of the big car. From the platform
a flight of steps led to the ground, and the
Bunker children got out on this platform and
so descended.</p>

<p>“What’s this for?” asked Violet, with her
usual way of starting questions.</p>

<p>“This,” her father told her, “is a milk platform.”</p>

<p>“What’s a milk——” began Vi, but her
father held up his hand.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about it, and then you
won’t have to ask any more questions,” he
said, with a smile. “This platform is built for
the farmer to set his cans of milk on. It is
made high, so it is easy to roll the cans of milk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
from the platform into the wagon. The milk
is collected by a big wagon, or auto truck,
from the cheese factory. Many farmers
around here sell their milk and cream to the
cheese factory, and these platforms are built
to make the work easier.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured Violet. She had never
had so many questions answered before without
her asking any, and she was in rather a
daze.</p>

<p>“Now run along and play with the others,”
her father told her, for the five little Bunkers
were wandering about, looking at things
around the farmhouse.</p>

<p>Mr. Armstrong owned the place, and he
came out to shake hands with Mr. Bunker and
Adam North, telling the latter to take as much
water as he needed for the thirsty automobile.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong invited the children in and
gave them some cookies and glasses of milk.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid you’ll spoil your appetites
for dinner by eating now?” asked Daddy
Bunker. “It’s eleven o’clock, and we’ll have
lunch about noon.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can eat again,” said Russ.</p>

<p>“So can I.” “And I!” cried the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“Bless their hearts!” laughed the motherly
Mrs. Armstrong.</p>

<p>While the auto engine was cooling the children
ran about and played tag. Rose thought
perhaps her mother and Norah might come
past in the touring car, but Adam said they
had probably taken a shorter way, over a back
road.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t go that way because the truck
is so heavy,” he explained. “I have to stick
to the hard highways. But we’ll meet your
mother in Westfield.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on out and see what I found!”
cried Margy, running around the corner of
the house.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“A lot of little pigs in a pen, and they squeal
like anything!” Margy answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to see the pigs! Maybe I can
make up a riddle about ’em!” cried Laddie.</p>

<p>There was a rush for the pen, and the children
had fun watching the little pigs stumble
about, rooting with their pink noses in the
dirt of their pen for something to eat.</p>

<p>But now the engine was cool enough to
travel on, and Mr. Bunker called the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
to come back. Russ was the first to reach the
machine, running up the platform steps ready
to help his smaller brothers and sisters if they
needed it.</p>

<p>He peered inside the truck, thinking perhaps
the straw would need spreading out
again in a smooth layer, and, as he did so, he
started back in surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Rose, who had
followed him.</p>

<p>“There’s something in there—in the straw,”
whispered Russ.</p>

<p>“You mean one of the children?” asked
Rose, for thus she often spoke of her smaller
brothers and sister.</p>

<p>“No, it—it looks like some animal,” said
Russ. “Look!”</p>

<p>Rose looked and saw a dark object—clearly
an animal—moving about in the straw.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe it’s a bear!” she cried.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">AT FARMER JOEL’S</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Four other little Bunkers were hurrying
up the platform steps to get into the auto
truck when Rose and Russ made this discovery
of a strange animal in the straw.</p>

<p>The first impulse of Rose was to run from
the animal that, she half thought, might be a
bear that had wandered in from the woods not
far away and had found the warm straw a
good place in which to sleep. The next
thought Rose had was for her smaller brothers
and sisters.</p>

<p>Daddy Bunker and Adam North were up
near the front of the truck, getting ready to
take their seats, for the engine was now cool
and the radiator filled with fresh water.</p>

<p>Russ had the same idea as had Rose—the
desire to save his brothers and sisters from
harm. Seeing them coming up the platform
steps he cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“Keep back! Keep back! Don’t come up
here!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Laddie.</p>

<p>“There’s something in the straw,” Russ
answered.</p>

<p>“It’s an animal!” added Rose. “A big
animal!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to see it!” cried Mun Bun. “I
like animals! Maybe we can have a circus—this
is like a circus wagon!”</p>

<p>The big truck certainly was. But Rose did
not intend to have Mun Bun or the other
small ones rush into danger. She stood on
the milk platform at the top of the steps, holding
out her hands.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t go in there where the animal
is!” cried Rose. “Russ, can’t you do something?”
and her voice was shrill with excitement.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a stick—a stone—something——” panted
Russ.</p>

<p>Just then from inside the truck came a
stamping sound, as if the animal were kicking
about. At the same time a loud cry echoed.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Daddy Bunker,
coming back from the front end of the truck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>At the same time Mr. Armstrong, the
farmer, hurried out of a side gate, calling:</p>

<p>“Did any of you see a little colt? He got
out of the pasture, and I don’t want him to
run away. He’s valuable and he may get
hurt.”</p>

<p>Before any one could answer the sound of
neighing came from inside the truck, and then
Russ knew it was made by the animal he and
Rose had seen standing in the straw.</p>

<p>“Ha! That sounds like my colt!” said
Farmer Armstrong.</p>

<p>“It is!” shouted Russ, with a laugh. “He’s
in the auto. I’ll get him out.”</p>

<p>The oldest Bunker boy started to go inside
the auto truck, whence came the neighing,
stamping sound of the little horse. But Mr.
Armstrong called out:</p>

<p>“No, lad, don’t go in there. He might kick
you. Not that he’s ugly, but he’s in a strange
place, and if you go in he might think you
meant to harm him. Better let me do it. I
know how to handle that colt.”</p>

<p>The six little Bunkers, with their father and
Adam North, stood at one side to allow Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
Armstrong to enter the truck. In he went,
speaking soothing words to the little colt.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho, Bonnie Boy! So you thought
you’d hide away and go with the six little
Bunkers, did you? None of that! We want
you to stay on our farm! So you tried to hide
in the straw, did you, Bonnie Boy? Well,
come out and I’ll give you a lump of sugar.”</p>

<p>And out of the truck, onto the milk platform,
walked Mr. Armstrong, leading by his
halter the colt Bonnie Boy, as he was named.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he sweet?” cried Violet. “How
old is he and where is his mother and has he
any brothers and sisters and——”</p>

<p>“Careful, Vi!” laughingly called her father.
“Mr. Armstrong isn’t used to having so many
questions fired at him at once.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” laughed the good-natured
farmer. “But this is the only little
colt I have, and his mother is down in the
south pasture. Now you can pet him if you
want to,” he added to the children. “He
won’t kick when he’s outside here where he
can see who is near him.”</p>

<p>Up on the platform, around Bonnie Boy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
crowded the six little Bunkers, and the colt
rubbed his velvet-like nose against them and
whinnied softly.</p>

<p>“And to think I took him for a bear!”
laughed Rose, as she stroked the glossy neck
of the colt.</p>

<p>“Well, he did look like one,” declared
Russ.</p>

<p>“Did he walk up the steps?” asked Violet.
“I don’t see how he could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a great little colt,” said Mr. Armstrong
proudly. “He does all sorts of tricks.
One day he got out of the pasture and walked
right into the kitchen where my wife was
making a cake. She thought I was coming in
with my big boots on, so she didn’t turn
around, and the colt put his nose on the back
of her neck. She—Ha! Ha! She thought I
was kissing her. Oh, ho! ho!” and the farmer
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>Then he led Bonnie Boy down the steps, the
little colt making no trouble at all about treading
on them. He was taken back to the pasture
where his mother was waiting for him,
doubtless wondering what had become of him.
It was found that there was a break in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
fence, just large enough for the colt to squeeze
through, but not large enough for his mother,
or she would have followed him.</p>

<p>The colt had wandered about, coming up
to the rear of the house, and had then made
his way to the front, going up the steps of the
milk platform, and so into the big straw-filled
truck, which, perhaps, he thought was a new
kind of barn.</p>

<p>“Well, now we’d better be traveling,” said
Mr. Bunker, when the little colt was taken
away. “We don’t want to be late in meeting
mother in Westfield.”</p>

<p>Once again the six little Bunkers were on
their way.</p>

<p>They were soon at Westfield, a small country
town, and when the big truck drew up in
front of the only restaurant in the place there
was the touring car, with Mrs. Bunker and
Norah sitting in it, waiting.</p>

<p>“We got here first, and we would have been
here before but I had a puncture and we had
to change a tire,” said Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” remarked her husband.</p>

<p>“Did you have any adventures?” asked
Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I should say we did!” cried Violet
“There was——”</p>

<p>“The cutest little colt!” broke in Rose, “and
he——”</p>

<p>“Was in the straw,” continued Russ, “and
when Rose saw him she——”</p>

<p>“Thought he was a bear,” said Laddie.</p>

<p>Thus several of the little Bunkers had a
turn in telling what had happened.</p>

<p>“That was quite an adventure!” laughed
Mrs. Bunker, when she had been told all that
had taken place at the Armstrong farm.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to make up a riddle about the
colt, but I haven’t got very far yet,” said Laddie.
“It’s something about straw and a horseshoe
and—oh, well, maybe I’ll think of it after
a while,” he said hopefully.</p>

<p>They had a delightful time, lunching in the
restaurant, and nothing much happened except
that Mun Bun spilled a glass of water in
his lap and got wet. But as it was a warm day
it didn’t matter.</p>

<p>Margy discovered a little kitten wandering
about the eating place, and she insisted on
giving pussy some of her milk. The result
was, Margy’s hands not being very steady,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
that she upset a glass of milk on the floor.</p>

<p>But, as the restaurant keeper said, it didn’t
matter, for the floor needed mopping anyhow.</p>

<p>Once more the little party started off in the
two automobiles, Mrs. Bunker and Norah in
the touring car taking the lead. In about an
hour more they were at Cedarhurst. Then
very soon, turning down a quiet country road,
the six little Bunkers saw in the distance a
white farmhouse in the middle of broad fields—a
farmhouse with barns and other buildings
around it.</p>

<p>“That’s a dandy place!” exclaimed Russ.</p>

<p>“Lovely,” murmured Rose.</p>

<p>“Is that where we’re going to stay?” asked
Violet.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is Farmer Joel’s,” her father
answered.</p>

<p>A little later the little Bunkers were fairly
tumbling out of the auto truck in their eagerness
to see all the sights. Mrs. Bunker and
Norah were already at the place.</p>

<p>“My, but I’m glad to see you all!” cried
Farmer Joel, and the six little Bunkers needed
but one look at him to make sure they would
love him, for Mr. Todd was a kindly man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
And his sister, Miss Lavina, was just as loving
and kind.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you’re here,” said Miss
Todd. “Now that I see so many lovely children
it makes me want to stay and play with
you. But brother Joel says I need a vacation,
so I’m going off on a visit.”</p>

<p>The big farm was the most delightful place
in the world at which to spend a vacation.
As Adam North had said, there were broad
fields—some green pastures, and others where
hay and grain were growing. There were two
orchards, one of apple trees and another of
peach trees.</p>

<p>“And don’t eat apples yet, for they aren’t
ripe,” warned Farmer Joel as the children,
putting on their old clothes, started out to
explore things.</p>

<p>“I want to see some horses!” cried Laddie.</p>

<p>“I want to go where the sheep are,” Mun
Bun said.</p>

<p>“So do I,” chimed in Margy.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to the kitchen to help mother,”
offered Rose, but her mother said:</p>

<p>“No, you run out and play now. Norah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
and I can manage the work all right. Later
on if you want to help you may.”</p>

<p>So Rose went out with Russ and the others.</p>

<p>“There’s a brook, Russ!” called Violet, as
she caught sight of the sparkle of a little
stream.</p>

<p>“That’s good. Then I’ll make a water
wheel and a mill,” said Russ.</p>

<p>He and Laddie were looking at the brook,
poking in sticks to find out how deep it was
and making ready to build the dam for the
water wheel, when suddenly they heard the
voice of Rose crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, drive him away! Make him go away!
Oh! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Russ, looking up.</p>

<p>“It was Rose,” answered Laddie. “I
guess——”</p>

<p>The loud barking of a dog interrupted him,
and Rose cried again:</p>

<p>“Oh, Russ, come and drive him away!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="fs80">IN THE HAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Russ looked up from the dam he was making
for the water wheel. He could not see
Rose. Nor could Laddie, who was helping
his brother make the little mill pond. But
Rose kept on yelling and the dog kept on
barking.</p>

<p>“Oh, somebody please come!” cried Rose.</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” shouted Russ.</p>

<p>He leaped up, followed by Laddie, and, as
they turned around a clump of bushes and
looked down the brook they saw Rose standing
with her back against a big tree while in
front of her, leaping about and barking
loudly, was a large brown dog.</p>

<p>“Oh, Russ! Russ!” begged his sister, as she
caught sight of him and Laddie. “Come and
drive this dog away! He wants to bite me!”</p>

<p>“I’ll drive him away!” declared Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“And I’ll help,” added Laddie. “He’s a
bad dog!”</p>

<p>Before the two brothers could reach their
sister there came running toward Rose another
boy. This boy had a freckled face and
red hair.</p>

<p>“Don’t hit my dog!” cried this red-haired
boy. “He won’t hurt you. Hi, Jimsie!”
called this new boy, “behave yourself!
Down! Quiet! Quit your barking!”</p>

<p>The dog looked around at the voice,
wagged his tail to show that he was friendly,
and stopped barking. Just then up rushed
Russ and Laddie with sticks in their hands.
Rose also had a stick which she had raised
toward the dog, but she had not hit him.</p>

<p>“Don’t beat my dog Jimsie!” begged the
strange boy. “He didn’t mean any harm.”</p>

<p>“What did he try to bite my sister for?”
demanded Russ, who was angry.</p>

<p>“Oh, he didn’t exactly try to <em>bite</em> me,” said
Rose. “He just barked a lot and he wouldn’t
let me get away, and I was afraid he’d bite
me.”</p>

<p>“Jimsie wouldn’t bite anybody,” said the
boy, whose name was Ralph Watson. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
lived on the farm next to that of Mr. Todd.</p>

<p>“Well, then, what made him bark at my
sister?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“’Cause she had a stick,” answered Ralph.</p>

<p>“Does he bark at everybody who has a
stick?” asked Laddie. “If he does why
doesn’t he bark at Russ and me—we have
sticks?”</p>

<p>“I guess he will bark at you as soon as he
sees you have sticks,” Ralph answered. “I’ll
try him.” He moved around until he stood
beside Russ and Laddie, and as the dog’s eyes
followed his young master Jimsie caught sight
of the two Bunker boys and the sticks they
held. At once Jimsie began to bark, greatly
excited.</p>

<p>“There! I told you!” cried Ralph.</p>

<p>“What makes him bark so just because he
sees a stick?” asked Russ. “Does he think
we’re going to hit him with ’em? I wouldn’t
hit any dog, unless he was going to bite somebody.”</p>

<p>“No, Jimsie doesn’t think he’s going to be
hit,” explained Ralph. “He just wants you
to throw the sticks in the brook so he can jump
in and bring ’em out. Always when he sees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
any one with a stick he thinks they’re going to
play with him and throw the stick into the
water. I guess he thought you were going to
play with him,” said Ralph to Rose, “and
when you didn’t—why, he just barked.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” exclaimed Rose, with a laugh,
for she was over her fright now. “That was
his way of asking me to throw the stick in the
water.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Ralph with a smile that
lighted up his jolly, freckled face. “Sometimes
he barks like anything when I take a
stick and don’t throw it in for him to bring
out.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, Jimsie seemed very much excited
now because Russ and Laddie would not
toss their sticks into the brook. And at last, to
please the dog, Russ tossed his stick in.</p>

<p>Instantly Jimsie plunged in after it, swimming
out and bringing the stick back to shore,
dropping it at the feet of Russ as if asking
that it be thrown in again.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t he cute!” exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>“He’s a good dog!” declared Russ.</p>

<p>“Will he bring out a stick for me?” asked
Laddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“He’ll do it for anybody,” answered Ralph.</p>

<p>“I’ll try it,” said Laddie.</p>

<p>In he tossed his stick, and in plunged Jimsie
after it, bringing it back to shore, which made
Laddie laugh. Then Jimsie gave himself a
shake, sending a shower of drops all over
Rose, who was near him.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the little Bunker girl in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Jimsie, don’t you know any better than
that?” cried Ralph, in a scolding voice.
“Shame on you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” said Rose quickly.
“This is an old dress and water won’t spot it.
There, go in and get my stick!” she ordered,
as she tossed hers into the brook. “You
wanted me to throw it before, but I didn’t
know what you meant by your barking. Now
get the stick.”</p>

<p>Jimsie quickly brought the stick to shore
for Rose. Then Ralph tossed one in and his
dog got that. Russ and Laddie wanted to try
their sticks over again, but Rose said:</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor dog will get tired! Don’t
make him do so much.”</p>

<p>“He likes it,” Ralph said. “He’d chase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
sticks all day, I guess, if you’d throw ’em for
him. But maybe it’s time he quit. I have to
go after the cows, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Where are they? Could we go with
you?” asked Laddie eagerly.</p>

<p>“Do you live around here?” Russ wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Ralph Watson told his name and where he
lived, but he said it was a long distance to the
cow pasture where he had to go, and he added
that the mother of the Bunker children might
not let them go.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to-morrow if you want to
come, though,” Ralph promised.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll go,” said Rose.</p>

<p>Then, in answer to a question, she told the
others that she had been walking along the
brook looking for watercress, of which Daddy
Bunker was very fond. Rose was using the
stick to poke aside the bushes on the edge of
the brook when suddenly Jimsie had sprung
out at her, driving her back against the tree,
where she had stood, afraid to move while the
dog barked so furiously.</p>

<p>“If I had only known he wanted to play I’d
have played with him,” finished Rose, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
laugh. “But I thought he was a savage dog.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jimsie is never ugly,” said Ralph.
“He barks a lot, but I guess that’s because he
has to do it when he helps me drive the cows.
Well, I’ll see you again,” he added, as he
started away with his dog.</p>

<p>“He’s a nice boy,” said Rose, when he was
out of sight.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have that dog,” remarked Russ.</p>

<p>“I think—now maybe—I guess I have a
riddle about a dog,” began Laddie, but before
he could ask it, or even before he could think
what it was, yells and screams came from another
part of the brook.</p>

<p>“That’s Mun Bun!” exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>“Sounded like Margy, too,” said Russ.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ve fallen into the water,” suggested
Laddie.</p>

<p>Just then Violet was heard asking:</p>

<p>“Oh, what did you want to go and do that
for? Now you have gone and done it! Are
your feet wet? Did you get hurt, Mun Bun?”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” laughed Russ, as he and the others
started on a run for the place whence the
voices sounded. “I guess Vi would ask questions
if the house was on fire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“Sounds as if Margy and Mun Bun had
fallen into the brook,” said Rose.</p>

<p>And that’s just what had happened. The
three older Bunkers came upon Violet, Margy
and Mun Bun a few seconds later. It was at
a place where a small plank was laid across
the brook as a bridge.</p>

<p>Standing in the water on one side of the
plank was Mun Bun. In the water up to her
knees on the other side of the plank, was
Margy. Both children were in the middle of
the brook, and Violet was on one shore.</p>

<p>“I guess Mun Bun’s feet are wet, and
Margy’s, too!” chuckled Russ. “What’s the
matter, Vi?” he asked. “What happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, these children started to cross the little
bridge, and Margy wanted to go first and
Mun Bun wanted to go first, and they pushed
and shoved and———”</p>

<p>“Which one went into the water first?”
asked Rose, with a laugh, for, after all, the
accident was not a bad one.</p>

<p>“I fell in first!” cried Mun Bun, as if this
was something to be proud of.</p>

<p>“No, I did!” declared Margy.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d both better come out,” advised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Rose. “You’ll have to go up to the house and
get on dry shoes and stockings.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to ask mother if I can’t go barefoot,”
said Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” declared Margy.</p>

<p>Their mother let them go barefoot after
scolding them a little for getting their shoes
and stockings wet. She said they should
have been more polite and not have tried
one to get ahead of the other in crossing
the plank.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’ll have to expect such
things as wet feet and muddy clothes if the
children play about the farm,” said Farmer
Joel’s sister, who was getting ready to go off
on her vacation.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind as long as the children
aren’t hurt,” said their mother, with a laugh.
“They’ll get used to the place after a while
and know how to have fun without getting
into too much trouble. Don’t go far away
now,” she added. “Supper will soon be
ready.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay and help set the table,” offered
Rose. And as Miss Todd would be busy with
her own affairs and as Norah had the cooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
to look after, Mrs. Bunker was glad of Rose’s
help.</p>

<p>Russ and Laddie went back to where they
had been building the water wheel when Rose
was frightened by the dog, and Violet, Mun
Bun and Margy said they would go with
Adam North, who started out to the barn to
gather the eggs.</p>

<p>“Where do the hens lay their eggs?” asked
Violet, starting some of her usual questions.</p>

<p>“Oh, in different places,” answered the
hired man. “Sometimes away under the barn,
and I have to crawl under the beams to get
them out.”</p>

<p>“We could do that for you,” offered Violet.
“We’re small and we could easy fit under the
barn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do have trouble there,” replied
Adam. “Once I got stuck under the barn
floor.”</p>

<p>“Did you have to stay there a long time?”
Violet asked.</p>

<p>“I did until they could take up some boards
in the floor and let me crawl out that way,”
laughed Adam.</p>

<p>Violet watched him go about in different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
places in the barn to gather the eggs. She saw
Margy and Mun Bun climbing about in the
haymow, and then she forgot about her little
brother and sister for a few moments, as Adam
found a nest with more than a dozen eggs in
it and called Violet to look at them.</p>

<p>When she returned to the middle of the
barn she could not see either Mun Bun or
Margy.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” she called.</p>

<p>Back came the answer, but in queer, muffled
voices.</p>

<p>“We’re in the hay,” roared Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“And we can’t get out and it’s dark!” wailed
Margy.</p>

<p>“What has happened to them?” Violet
asked Adam North.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="fs80">WHEN THE COWS CAME HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The hired man carefully set down the
basket of eggs he had gathered from different
places in the barn. Then he looked up toward
the haymow. This mow was where the hay
was piled in the barn to be kept dry so it could
be fed to the horses.</p>

<p>“Were Margy and Mun Bun up there?”
asked Adam of Violet.</p>

<p>“Yes, they went up there to slide down.
Hay’s slippery, you know,” answered Violet.
“Course it isn’t as slippery as snow or ice, but
you can slide down hill on a pile of hay.”</p>

<p>“I know,” chuckled Adam. “I often used
to do it when I was a boy on the farm. But
I don’t see the children now.”</p>

<p>“You can hear them—listen!” advised
Violet.</p>

<p>Again came the voices of Mun Bun and
Margy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“We’re in the dark! We’re in the dark!”
wailed Margy, who did not like dark places.</p>

<p>“An’ the hay tickles me, it does!” howled
Mun Bun. “I don’t like the hay to tickle me!
Vi! Vi! Come and get me!”</p>

<p>Violet climbed up a little ladder that led
from the floor of the barn to the top of the
haymow. The ladder went all the way to the
roof of the barn, for in winter the haymow
was piled that full. But now there was only a
little hay in the mow. It rose a few feet over
the head of Adam as he stood on the barn
floor, and Violet did not have to climb up
many rungs of the ladder to see over the top
of the pile of hay.</p>

<p>“They aren’t here!” she called down to
Adam. “I can’t see Margy or Mun Bun anywhere,
but I can hear them. And I hear a
hen cackling.”</p>

<p>“I guess a hen has her nest up there,” said
the hired man.</p>

<p>“Maybe the hen bit Margy and Mun Bun,”
suggested Violet.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder but what she might
peck at ’em if they tried to move her off her
nest,” chuckled the hired man. “But she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
couldn’t hurt ’em much. Let me get up there,
Violet. I think I can find Margy and Mun
Bun.”</p>

<p>Violet climbed up higher on the ladder until
she could step off upon the soft, springing
pile of hay. Adam North followed her, and
then, going to one corner of the mow, the
hired man called:</p>

<p>“Here they are! I’ve found ’em!”</p>

<p>“Where were they?” asked Vi. “Were they
hiding?”</p>

<p>“Well, sort of,” answered Adam, with a
smile, as he reached down in the hay and
lifted up first Margy and then Mun Bun.
“But I guess they didn’t hide on purpose.
They slipped down into the feed chute.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Vi.</p>

<p>“It’s the place where we push hay down to
the horses in their stalls,” explained the hired
man. “If you don’t know the feed chutes are
here it’s easy to slip in ’em and fall down to
the stalls.”</p>

<p>“Oh, would you get killed?” asked Violet,
with widely opened eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Adam. “All that would
happen would be that you’d fall into the horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
manger, and if the horse was there you might
scare it a bit. But there aren’t any horses in
the barn just now.”</p>

<p>Mun Bun and Margy, both of whom had
been crying, now stopped, and Violet looked
at the place where they had been lost in the
hay. At the rear of the mow were several
long wooden places, like chimneys, made of
smooth boards. Down these “chimneys,”
or chutes, hay could be pushed, dropping
into the mangers of the horses stabled
below.</p>

<p>Margy and Mun Bun had been running
and sliding about on the pile of hay and, without
knowing it, had come too near the feed
chute. Into it they both slipped at the same
time, carrying with them some wads of the
dried grass.</p>

<p>As both children slid into the upright chute
at the same time, they became wedged fast,
together with some hay, and this stopped them
from sliding all the way down to the manger.
And there they had remained, caught fast, until
Adam pulled them out.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked the hired man, as
he helped the little ones down the ladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“No,” answered Margy. “But it was awful
dark!”</p>

<p>“And the hay tickled the back of my neck,”
added Mun Bun. “I sneezed.”</p>

<p>“And when he sneezed he made me bump
my nose and I—now, I cried,” confessed
Margy.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re all right now,” said Violet
consolingly. “And maybe you can find some
eggs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d like to find eggs!” exclaimed
Margy, quickly drying her tears.</p>

<p>“So would I,” added her brother, rubbing
his eyes with his fists.</p>

<p>“All right, come on!” said Adam North.
“I haven’t gathered all the eggs yet—not half,
I guess.”</p>

<p>So the children had a good time looking for
the nests in the different places the hens had
hidden them. A hen, you know, likes to “steal
her nest,” as the farmers call it. That is, she
likes to sneak away in some quiet place and
lay her eggs. Each day, or every other day,
she will lay an egg in the same place. And,
if the nest is not found for a week or more,
sometimes there may be a dozen eggs in it, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
often two or more hens may lay eggs in the
same nest, taking turns.</p>

<p>And, when there are a dozen, or perhaps
thirteen, eggs in the nest, some hen will begin
to “set” on them—hovering over them for
three weeks until little chickens hatch out of
the eggs. The warm body and feathers on
the mother hen bring the little chickens to
life inside the egg, and with their beaks they
pick open the shell and come out.</p>

<p>It is because a hen does not like to be disturbed
when she is hatching out her eggs that
she steals away to make her nest in as quiet
and as dark a place as she can find. But farmers
who raise eggs to sell do not always want
them hatched out into chickens, so that is why
it is needful to hunt for these hidden nests to
take away the eggs.</p>

<p>“There’s a nest away back in there,” said
Adam, who had looked under a low part of
the barn. “I see some eggs, but I can’t reach
them.”</p>

<p>“Let me crawl in an’ get ’em!” begged Mun
Bun.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess you’ll have to. I’m too big
to get under there,” said the hired man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“I want to get half the eggs,” said Margy.</p>

<p>But it was decided that it would be best for
Mun Bun only to crawl under the low place
in the barn, and soon he was wiggling and
crawling his way there, toward the hen’s nest.</p>

<p>“If the old hen is on won’t she pick him?”
asked Violet.</p>

<p>“There’s no hen on. If there had been I
should have seen her,” Adam North answered.
“Mun Bun will be all right if he
doesn’t get stuck fast under the barn as I once
was.”</p>

<p>But nothing like this happened, and Mun
Bun brought out four eggs, one at a time, from
the hidden nest. He was a proud little boy
when he crawled out with the last egg, not
having broken one.</p>

<p>“I like egg-hunting,” he said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Back to Farmer Joel’s house went Margy,
Mun Bun, and Violet with Adam, who was
carrying the eggs. Every one laughed when
they all heard how Margy and Mun Bun had
been stuck in the feed chute.</p>

<p>It was now almost supper time, and Mother
Bunker told the children to wash and get
ready for the meal. Mr. Todd’s sister was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
to leave on her journey soon after supper.</p>

<p>The meal was a merry one, for Farmer Joel
was jolly and made a lot of jokes. He even
started Laddie’s trick of asking riddles, and
he asked many funny ones—riddles to which
there was no answer.</p>

<p>Then, after supper, Farmer Joel drove his
sister over to the railroad station, where she
was to take a train to visit some relatives in
the West.</p>

<p>The six little Bunkers were so tired after
their day of travel and their afternoon of fun
on the farm that they went to bed early.
There was plenty of room in Farmer Joel’s
house.</p>

<p>Sleeping in strange beds did not keep the
children awake, and they were soon sound
asleep. Mrs. Bunker lay awake, however,
making plans for the next day, and she was
somewhat surprised when, after she had been
in bed an hour, she saw a ghostly white little
figure coming into her room.</p>

<p>“Who is it? What do you want?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to find the eggs!” murmured the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
voice of Margy. “I’ve got to crawl under and
get the eggs!”</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Bunker did not know
what to think as she saw Margy get down on
her hands and knees and begin to crawl under
the bed. Then, as Mrs. Bunker picked up her
little daughter, she saw that Margy’s eyes
were staring in a strange fashion.</p>

<p>“She’s walking and talking in her sleep!”
she exclaimed to Daddy Bunker. “Wake up,
Margy! Wake up!” she called, giving
Margy a gentle shake.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is it morning?”
asked Margy, in a sleepy voice, and then she
blinked her eyes and looked around in surprise.
“Oh!” she exclaimed. “What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“You were thinking so hard about hunting
eggs that you got up in your sleep and began
to search for some under my bed,” said Mrs.
Bunker gently, as she carried Margy back to
her own room. “Go to sleep now.”</p>

<p>Margy did. Nothing else happened that
night, and the children were up bright and
early the next morning. The day was filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
with fun. Russ and Laddie finished their
water wheel, about which I shall tell you
more later.</p>

<p>Rose, after helping her mother, went down
to the brook to gather watercress for her
father, Farmer Joel having told her where to
find some, and Margy, Violet and Mun Bun
had a little picnic by themselves under the
trees in the orchard.</p>

<p>It was toward the close of the afternoon
that the barking of a dog was heard in front
of the farmhouse. The six little Bunkers
were in the back yard having some bread and
jam that Norah had brought out to them.</p>

<p>“Maybe that is Ralph come to take us after
the cows!” cried Russ.</p>

<p>So it proved, but when all six little Bunkers
wanted to go to the distant pasture to
help Ralph gather up his herd, Mrs. Bunker
said:</p>

<p>“It’s too far for Margy and Mun Bun. But
you four may go if you wish.” She knew
where the cow pasture was.</p>

<p>Mun Bun and Margy began to cry, as they
wanted to go also, but Farmer Joel said they
could go egg-hunting with Adam, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
pleased the smaller children so that smiles
drove away their tears.</p>

<p>The path to the cow pasture lay through
pleasant fields, and half way to the place was
a clear, sparkling spring of water at which
the children stopped for a drink.</p>

<p>Then they climbed a hill, went down in a
little valley, and as they reached a broad field,
Ralph said:</p>

<p>“Here’s where we pasture our cows. But I
don’t see all of them—the two black ones are
missing.” There were ten cows in the pasture
where there should have been twelve.</p>

<p>“Do you think anybody stole those two
cows?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered Ralph. “I guess they
just wandered away. They do, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“What do you have to do?” Violet wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Have to hunt ’em,” Ralph answered.
“Jimsie helps me. There are lots of places
where cows can hide in this pasture—lots of
low places, and bushes and trees. Sometimes
it takes me an hour to find the lost cows.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you yell for ’em?” asked
Laddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“I will,” said Ralph. “Co, boss! Co, boss!
Co, boss!” he called loudly, the hills echoing
his voice.</p>

<p>Then the other children called:</p>

<p>“Co, boss! Co, boss! Co, boss!”</p>

<p>But the missing cows did not come out of
the cool, shady places where, doubtless, they
had gone to keep out of the sun.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to scatter and look for ’em,”
said Ralph. He and his dog Jimsie went one
way, Rose and Russ went another way, and
Laddie and Violet a third way. Soon the
three searching parties were some distance
apart.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, from a part of the pasture
where there was a dense clump of bushes,
came shrieks from Violet.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve found the cows! We’ve found
them, but they’re going to hook us!” she yelled.
“Russ! Russ! The cows are going to hook
us!”</p>

</div>

<p>Russ and Rose, who had been walking
along the shores of a little brook looking for
the missing cows, heard Violet’s yells. A moment
later they heard shouts from Laddie.
He was saying:</p>

<p>“Get back there, you old cows! Get back
there! Don’t you dare hook my sister!”</p>

<p>Then Violet’s voice sounded again:</p>

<p>“Oh, but Laddie, they are going to hook
me! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>“Come on!” called Russ to his sister Rose,
and together they rushed up out of the little
glen where the stream ran and hastened
toward the clump of trees and bushes whence
came the voices of Laddie and Violet. Ralph
and his dog were not in sight.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose the cows are trying to
hook Laddie and Violet with their horns?”
asked Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t think cows would,” panted Russ
as he ran on followed by Rose, who could not
go quite so fast. “Cows don’t hook you, I
guess, but bulls do, though I didn’t hear
Ralph say there were any bulls in this
pasture.”</p>

<p>“Is a bull worse than a cow?” Rose asked.</p>

<p>“For hooking you a bull is the worst there
is,” Russ answered. “But I don’t suppose it’s
a bull. Maybe the cows are only shaking
their heads at Violet and she thinks they’re
trying to hook her.”</p>

<p>And this is just what had happened. Laddie
and Violet had found the lost cows. The
two black animals were standing peacefully
in a shady place, chewing their cud. Perhaps
they were day-dreaming, if cows ever do such
things. At any rate the cows paid no attention
to the “co, boss” called by the children.</p>

<p>Laddie had fairly stumbled upon the hiding
place of the cows, and as Russ and Rose
reached the place they saw Laddie and his
twin sister standing with their backs against
a big tree, as Rose had stood when Jimsie
barked at her.</p>

<p>In front of Laddie and Violet were the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
cows, chewing their cud, as I have said. But
as Russ looked he could see no signs that the
cows were going to “hook” Violet, as she had
shouted they were about to do.</p>

<p>However, just as Russ and Rose reached
the place one of the cows shook her head violently
and Vi screamed:</p>

<p>“There! Look! The old thing wants to
hook me! Oh, Russ! Oh, Rose! Laddie!
Why don’t you do something!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly!” exclaimed Russ, who had
little patience with Violet sometimes. “She
isn’t going to hook you!”</p>

<p>“But what makes her shake her head?” demanded
Violet, half crying.</p>

<p>“She’s doing it to shake off the flies that are
biting her,” answered Russ, for he observed
that when the cow shook her head a cloud of
flies rose from behind her ears. “She’s
only doing it to get rid of the flies, Vi,” said
Russ.</p>

<p>“That’s what I told her, but she wouldn’t
believe me,” remarked Laddie. “I said the
cows wouldn’t hook her.”</p>

<p>“Well, they looked as if they were going
to hook me, anyhow,” said Violet, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
not frightened now that her older brother and
sister were there with her.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we found the cows, anyhow,”
said Rose. “Now we can drive ’em out with
the others and we can call Ralph and his dog
and go home.”</p>

<p>The two black cows that had wandered
away from the rest of the herd seemed gentle
enough when the children urged them out of
the shady bushes and into the open pasture.
The other ten cows were gathered down near
the pasture bars, waiting for them to be
opened.</p>

<p>Ralph and Jimsie came slowly up the hill
from another part of the pasture, where they
had gone to search for the missing animals.</p>

<p>“Oh, you found them! That’s good!” cried
the farm boy, as he saw Rose and Laddie
with Violet and Russ slowly driving the black
cows. “You were pretty lucky,” he added.
“Sometimes I’ve hunted an hour for lost
cows.”</p>

<p>“I guess Vi thinks she’s lucky they didn’t
hook her,” said Russ, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“What do you mean—hook her?” inquired
Ralph.</p>

<p>And when they told him he laughed and
said:</p>

<p>“Our cows never hook anybody—they’re
very gentle. But we have a bull in the barn
that’d hook you if he could get out. And
Mr. Todd’s got a bull, too.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t he get out?” Violet wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Because he’s chained fast to a ring in his
nose,” answered Ralph. “He dassn’t pull too
hard on the chain ’cause it hurts his nose. So
he has to be good. But if he got loose he’d
hook you all right.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t hook me! I’d throw stones
at him,” boasted Laddie.</p>

<p>“You’d better not try it if he ever does get
loose,” warned Ralph. “He wouldn’t mind
stones any more than if you chucked soft mud
at him. He’s awful strong.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I saw him coming I’d run,” went
on Laddie.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t do much good,” said
Ralph. “That bull can run faster than you.
If you ever do see him and he’s loose, keep
away from him or get on the other side of
the fence as fast as you can. Once he nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
hooked me, but I got to the fence first. He
ran right into the fence with his head down
and he bellowed like thunder.”</p>

<p>“Did it hurt him when he bunked into the
fence?” asked Vi.</p>

<p>“I guess maybe he didn’t feel it any more
than he’d feel a mosquito bite,” Ralph replied.
“He’s tough, our bull is.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! I hope he never gets out,”
murmured Rose, looking over her shoulder as
if she feared, even then, the bull might be
roaming somewhere about the pasture.</p>

<p>But he was not in sight and soon the children
were quietly driving the cows along the
road toward their barn on the farm of Ralph’s
father. In the barn the cows would be milked
and some of the milk would be sent to the
cheese factory.</p>

<p>“Well, did you have a good time?” asked
Mrs. Bunker, when her four children arrived
at Farmer Joel’s house after having gone for
the cows.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was fun. We had a little adventure,”
said Rose, and she told about the missing
cows.</p>

<p>Margy and Mun Bun listened with widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
opened eyes to the tale, and when it was over,
Mun Bun exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I wish I’d been there!”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, I would give the cows some salt and
they would love me,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Salt!” cried Russ. “Who ever heard of
giving cows salt?”</p>

<p>“It would make their milk salty!” declared
Laddie.</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t,” said Margy. “’Cause
when we went after eggs with Farmer Joel he
gave his cows some salt and when he milked
them he gave Mun Bun and me some of the
milk and it wasn’t salty at all, so there!”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it, Mother?” asked Rose, who
seemed to share Laddie’s idea.</p>

<p>“No, of course not, child,” said Mrs.
Bunker. “The farmers often give salt to their
cows, sheep and horses. Animals are very
fond of a small bit of salt. And while you
were gone Farmer Joel gave his cows some
lumps of rock salt which they licked with
their tongues, and seemed very fond of.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” remarked Laddie. “That’s the
first time I ever knew cows liked salt.” But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
later when he saw how horses in the pasture
followed Adam North about when he went to
“salt” them, and when the little boy watched
the sheep eagerly licking the salt in their field,
then he knew that his mother was right.</p>

<p>Happy days at Farmer Joel’s followed one
after another. The six little Bunkers never
had such delightful times. There seemed to
be something new to do all the while. They
roamed about the fields and woods, they gathered
eggs, they fed the chickens, and sometimes
they had picnics. They waded in the
brook and, once or twice, fell in and got
muddy. But this was expected.</p>

<p>One place that the children stayed away
from was the part of the farm where Mr.
Todd kept several hives of bees. The children
knew that bees stung and they did not
want this to happen to them.</p>

<p>About a week after the Bunkers had come
to stay at Farmer Joel’s, Russ and Laddie
were going to the brook to play with their
water wheel when suddenly they heard a loud
buzzing, humming sound in the air. At first
they thought it was a distant aeroplane, but,
looking up, they could see none. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
over in the direction of the bee orchard Russ
saw a dark cloud in the air. The buzzing
sound seemed to come from this dark cloud.</p>

<p>Then Russ knew what it was—a flight of
bees.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re running away!” he cried. “We
must tell Farmer Joel!”</p>

<p>He and Laddie hastened toward the house
and told the news. Mr. Todd ran out. As
soon as he heard the buzzing sound and saw
the moving dark cloud he cried:</p>

<p>“They’re swarming! I don’t want to lose
them! I must try to get them back!” Into
the house he hurried, to come out with a
queer, smoking machine in his hand. Over
his head Farmer Joel wore a broad-brimmed
straw hat with a veil of mosquito netting coming
down over his shoulders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">MUN BUN’S GARDEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The six little Bunkers, never having been
at Farmer Joel’s before and not knowing
much about bees, did not understand just what
was going to happen. In a general way the
Bunker children knew that bees made honey,
but how they did it, how the insects lived in
hives, with a queen bee who ruled over her
subjects almost like a real queen—of all this
the six little Bunkers knew nothing.</p>

<p>“What’s that thing he’s got on his head?”
asked Violet, pointing to the mosquito netting
veil that was draped over Farmer Joel’s hat.
“And what’s that tin funnel full of smoke he
carries?” For the machine in the farmer’s
hand was like a kitchen funnel, turned on one
side, and from the small end poured a cloud
of white smoke.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try to get back that swarm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
of bees,” called Mr. Todd as he hurried out
toward the trees under which were many
hives of the honey-making insects. “That
queen alone is worth fifty dollars. If she gets
away it will be a bad loss for me.”</p>

<p>Away he hurried, followed by a cloud of
smoke, and Rose asked:</p>

<p>“How in the world is he going to pick out
a queen bee from the million or more that
must be in the swarm?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Russ.</p>

<p>“Let’s go out and see how he does it,” proposed
Laddie, always ready to do something.
“Maybe I could think of a riddle about bees
if I went out there.”</p>

<p>“Most likely you’d be thinking about their
stings if you went out there,” laughed Mr.
Bunker. “You children stay here where you
can watch Farmer Joel, and I’ll tell you what
he is doing and how he can, perhaps, get back
his fifty dollar queen, and I’ll tell you a little
about how bees make honey.”</p>

<p>By this time Farmer Joel was out among
his bees. The dark cloud of the swarming
hive was right over his head, moving slowly
along like some great bubble—only it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
bubble full of life. In the middle of the
swarm was the queen bee and all her court
was following, going wherever she went.</p>

<p>“How is he going to catch them?” asked
Russ.</p>

<p>“He ought to have a butterfly net, or something
like that,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Farmer Joel isn’t exactly going to catch
the bees,” explained Daddy Bunker. “All he
can do is to follow them until the queen bee
lights on a tree branch, or some place like that.
When she does, all the other bees will cluster
around her, as thickly as possible. Then, if
Farmer Joel is lucky enough to find them, he
can take an empty hive, put it on the ground
under the queen bee and the bunch of worker
bees, jar them off into the hive, clap the cover
on, and bring it back to his apiary.”</p>

<p>“What’s an ap—an ap—ap—?” began Violet.</p>

<p>“An apiary means a place where bees are
kept,” explained Mr. Bunker. “It comes
from the Latin word <em>apis</em>, which means bee.
Now while we are waiting to see what happens
I’ll tell you a little about bees and why
they swarm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>The six little Bunkers looked at Farmer
Joel, with his smoking machine and his mosquito
netting hat, still following the slowly
moving swarm of bees toward the woods, and
then they turned to their father who had
promised to tell them something better than
a story.</p>

<p>“Bees are of three kinds,” said Mr. Bunker.
“There is the worker bee, of which there are
thousands in every swarm, or hive. The
drones are the father bees, and, I am sorry to
say, they are a lazy lot. They never work,
and they eat lots of honey, and sometimes,
when too many drones, or father bees, get into
a hive, the worker bees sting them to death,
for they can’t afford to feed too many lazy
bees that won’t work. Then, most important
of all, is the queen bee.”</p>

<p>“How can you or Farmer Joel tell one bee
from another?” inquired Violet, and this time
the other children were glad she had asked
the question, for this was something they
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“The queen bee is larger and longer than
any of the others,” answered Mr. Bunker,
“and even you, not knowing anything about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
bees, could easily pick her out of hundreds of
others. The drones are a little larger than
the workers, and the queer thing about the
drones is that they never sting. They have
no stings and cannot harm you. The queen
can sting, but she never does, or hardly ever;
for once a bee stings, it leaves the stinger in a
person or an animal, and that means the bee
dies. And it wouldn’t do to have the queen
bee die.”</p>

<p>“What would happen if she should die?”
asked Russ.</p>

<p>“That is taken care of by the worker bees,”
said Mr. Bunker. “In the cells, or little holes
in the wax honeycomb, are many eggs that
after a while will hatch out into other bees,
mostly workers or drones. The queen bee
lays the eggs that hatch into other bees. But
if it should happen that the queen should die,
the worker bees at once begin to feed to some
of the half-hatched little bees a peculiar kind
of food gathered from the flowers. It is a
sort of mixture of honey and juices from the
bees’ bodies. This is called royal food, royal
honey or queen bread. And when the half-hatched
little bees eat this strange food they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
are changed from ordinary bees into queen
bees.</p>

<p>“But as there can be but one queen in a
hive, if more hatch out all but one are killed,
and so the life in the hive goes on. The
new queen begins laying eggs, and more
drones, workers and perhaps more queens are
hatched. The workers fly off to the fields to
gather honey from the flowers, and they also
gather something else.”</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Russ. “Our teacher in
school told us! They gather yellow stuff. It
is called——”</p>

<p>“Pollen!” exclaimed Rose. “I know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” her father answered, “the bees
gather pollen, or the yellow dust from the
flowers, and by mixing this yellow dust with
some juices from their bodies they make beeswax,
from which the cells are built to hold
the sweet honey juice.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you said only one queen bee
could live in a swarm,” said Violet. “And
if the queen bee lays eggs and other queens
hatch out I should think——”</p>

<p>Mr. Bunker pointed to Farmer Joel, who
was still chasing after his runaway swarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what happens when two queens get
in a hive,” said Daddy Bunker. “One queen
leaves, taking with her perhaps half the
worker bees and some drones. They fly away
to start a new hive, swarm, or colony, as it is
sometimes called.</p>

<p>“But not always do bees swarm because
there are two queens in a hive. Often the
queen may take a notion that she would like
a new home, so out she flies and with her go
her faithful subjects, just as in real life the
subjects of a human king or queen follow
them.”</p>

<p>“Where do you think these bees will go?”
asked Rose.</p>

<p>“It is hard to say,” answered their father.
“It looks now as though they would go to the
woods,” for they could see the dark cloud of
insects near the edge of the forest. “They
may pick out some hollow tree and set up
housekeeping there, making a wax framework
to hold the honey juices they will later gather
from the flowers.”</p>

<p>“Then couldn’t Farmer Joel go to that hollow
tree and get the honey if he wanted to?”
asked Laddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, that is sometimes done,” his father
replied. “And he might even get his swarm
of bees back, if he could find the right hollow
tree. But that isn’t easy. In the olden days,
before men knew how to build little houses,
or hives, for the bees to live in, all the honey
was stored in hollow trees. But men studied
the ways of bees, they learned the manner in
which queens ruled and how swarming came
about, and they built hives in which it is easier
for the bees to store their honey, and from
which it is also easier to take it.”</p>

<p>“What about that smoke?” asked Rose. “I
didn’t know bees liked smoke.”</p>

<p>She was speaking of the queer machine that
Farmer Joel carried. They could see smoke
coming from it now in a cloud.</p>

<p>Later, when they had time to look at the
smoke machine, the six little Bunkers saw that
it was like a funnel with a bellows, or blower,
beneath it. A fire of rags or rotten wood
could be built in the larger part of the tin
funnel, and when the bellows was pressed this
blew out a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>“Bees don’t like smoke,” said Daddy
Bunker. “But when a cloud of it is blown on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
them it makes them rather stupid—it calms
and quiets them so they are less likely to sting
whoever is working around them. And a little
smoke does them no harm; though, of
course, if they had too much of it they would
die.</p>

<p>“So when a man works in his apiary he puts
a mosquito veil over his head and takes his
smoker. A few puffs from that down in a
hive of bees will so quiet the insects that he
can, with his bare hands, pick them up and
they will not sting him. In this way he can
also pick out the queen from among her
thousands of workers and put her in another
hive. If he can do this in time he will stop
the swarm from dividing, part of it flying
away, as just happened.”</p>

<p>“Bees are queer,” said Russ.</p>

<p>“Indeed, they are! But I like to hear about
them,” said Rose.</p>

<p>By this time Farmer Joel was out of sight
in the woods, where his runaway swarm had
gone, and as the children had not been allowed
to follow they played about, waiting for Mr.
Todd to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Will he bring the bees back with him?”
asked Russ.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, though he could if he had taken
a box with him,” said Mr. Bunker. “All he
will do, very likely, is to notice where they
light on a tree, perhaps. Then he may go
back this evening and shake them into a hive.”</p>

<p>It was late that afternoon when Farmer
Joel came back, very tired and looking rather
discouraged.</p>

<p>“Did you find the bees?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Mr. Todd. “They got
away, and they took with them a queen worth
fifty dollars. I wish I could have seen where
they went, for then I might get them. But
they are lost, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’ll ever find them
again?” Rose wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered Farmer Joel.
“I’ve lost one of my best swarms and a fine
queen bee. Yes, I’d give even more than fifty
dollars for her if I could get her back. Well,
it can’t be helped, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The six little Bunkers felt sorry for Farmer
Joel, and they wished they might help him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
but they did not see how they could go after
a queen and a swarm of stinging bees.</p>

<p>“Come to supper!” called Mrs. Bunker, a
little later, when Russ and Laddie were
working over their water wheel and mill, and
when Rose was swinging Margy and Violet
under the apple tree.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mun Bun?” asked his mother, as
the other little Bunkers came hurrying to the
house at her call.</p>

<p>“I saw him a little while ago,” answered
Violet. “He had a shovel and he was going
toward the garden.”</p>

<p>“I guess he was going to dig worms so he
could go fishing,” suggested Laddie. “He
asked me if there were fish in the brook.”</p>

<p>“See if you can find him, Russ,” begged his
mother.</p>

<p>Russ went toward the garden where he soon
saw Mun Bun busy making a hole, tossing the
dirt about with a small shovel.</p>

<p>“Hi there, Mun Bun!” called Russ. “You
shouldn’t dig in the garden. You might spoil
something that’s planted there.”</p>

<p>“Nuffin planted here,” said Mun Bun, as
he kept on digging. “I did ast Adam, an’ he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
said taters was here but he digged ’em all up.
Nuffin planted here, so I plant somethin’.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to plant?” asked Russ,
with a smile, while Rose and the other children
drew near.</p>

<p>“I goin’ to plant bones,” answered Mun
Bun, hardly looking up, so busy was he with
the shovel.</p>

<p>“Bones!” cried Russ. “You’re going to
plant bones?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mun Bun solemnly, “I
plant bones. Look out—you’re steppin’ on
my bones!” he cried, and he pointed to the
ground where lay a pile of chicken bones that
Norah had thrown out from dinner.</p>

<p>“Well, what kind of a garden are you making,
anyhow?” asked Russ. “Planting
bones!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I plant bones!” declared Mun Bun,
the youngest of the Bunkers, while the other
children looked on in wonder.</p>

<span class="fs80">A STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Bunker, seeing the group of children
gathered about Mun Bun, hurried across
the garden to see what it was all about.</p>

<p>“I hope nothing has happened to him,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Probably the worst that has happened is
that he’s dirty and you’ll have to scrub him
before he can come to the supper table,”
chuckled Daddy Bunker.</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be so bad,” replied his wife.
“I’m used to dirt, and I expect the children to
get grimy. That will wash off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk over with you and see what it’s
about. Something is going on, that’s sure!”
said Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bunker found five little
Bunkers grouped about the sixth, and youngest,
little Bunker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, look what Mun Bun’s doing!”
cried Violet.</p>

<p>“What is he doing?”</p>

<p>“He’s making the funniest kind of a bed in
the garden!” laughed Rose.</p>

<p>“A bed!” cried Mr. Bunker. “I hope he
isn’t going to sleep out here!”</p>

<p>“No, it’s a bed like a flower bed or a cabbage
bed,” explained Russ. “Only he’s
planting——”</p>

<p>“Bones!” burst out Laddie. “Oh, I could
make a funny riddle about it if I could think
of it.”</p>

<p>“Mun Bun, what in the world are you doing
with those bones?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“Plantin’ ’em,” answered the little fellow
coolly, as he dropped some of the chicken
bones into the hole he had dug and covered
them with earth.</p>

<p>“Why in the world are you planting
bones?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“So more bones will grow,” answered Mun
Bun, in a matter-of-fact way. “Farmer man
plants seeds to make things grow, an’ I plant
bones so more bones will grow.”</p>

<p>“Who for?” asked Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“For Jimsie, the dog,” answered the little
fellow. “Ralph said his dog never had
enough bones, so I’m going to plant bones and
then more bones will grow, an’ Jimsie can
come over here an’ pick off the bones when
they’re ripe an’——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear, foolish little boy!” cried his
mother, gathering him up in her arms and
kissing and hugging him, dirty as he was.
“Don’t you know bones don’t grow?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t they?” asked Mun Bun, in
surprise.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” chimed in Russ. “Only
seeds grow.”</p>

<p>“Um,” remarked Mun Bun, his face all rosy
where his mother had kissed him. “Den I
plant to-morrer some bird seed.”</p>

<p>“Why bird seed?” asked Daddy Bunker.</p>

<p>“So some birds will grow,” Mun Bun
answered.</p>

<p>Then how the other Bunkers laughed, especially
Daddy and Mother Bunker and Rose
and Russ, for they saw what a mistake Mun
Bun was making! Margy, Laddie and Violet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
laughed also, but more because the others did.
And then Mun Bun laughed himself.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry!” he announced.</p>

<p>“Maybe if you plant a knife and fork and
plate you’ll get something to eat!” chuckled
Russ.</p>

<p>They had many a good laugh over the queer
garden bed Mun Bun made when he thought
that if you planted bones a plant would spring
up with more bones on for Jimsie, the dog.
Then they all went in to supper.</p>

<p>“To-morrer,” said Mun Bun, as he was
taken off to bed later in the evening, “I’ll
plant some flowers for Jimsie to smell.”</p>

<p>Early the next day Mrs. Bunker was seen
in the kitchen with a sunbonnet on, while on
the table near her were a number of small
baskets.</p>

<p>“Are we going on a picnic?” asked Russ,
who came in to get a string to fix something
on the water wheel that he and Laddie were
constantly “fussing over,” as Norah called it.</p>

<p>“A sort of picnic,” answered his mother.
“Farmer Joel told me about a wild strawberry
patch beyond his south meadow, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
thought we could all go there and pick the
berries. There is a basket for each of us except
daddy, who isn’t going, and if we get
enough berries——”</p>

<p>“I’ll make a strawberry shortcake!” cried
Rose. “Excuse me for interrupting you,
Mother,” she went on, for it was impolite to
do that. “But I just couldn’t wait. May I
make a shortcake if we get any berries?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” answered Mrs. Bunker.
“Come, children,” she called to the others who
flocked into the kitchen, “we’ll have a good
time picking strawberries.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a better time when we eat the
shortcake,” laughed Russ.</p>

<p>“I know a riddle about a shortcake,” said
Laddie, wrinkling up his forehead. “I mean
I just made it up. Here it is. How can you
make a strawberry shortcake last the longest?”</p>

<p>“That isn’t a very good riddle,” objected
Rose.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see you answer it,” challenged
her small brother. “How can you make a
strawberry shortcake last longest?”</p>

<p>“Put it away in a safe,” guessed Violet.</p>

<p>“Nope!” answered Laddie, and before any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
one else could make a guess he cried: “Don’t
eat it. That’s how to make a strawberry shortcake
last longest—don’t eat it!”</p>

<p>“Well, if I made a cake I wouldn’t want it
to last very long,” laughed Rose. “I should
want people to eat it and tell me how good
it was.”</p>

<p>“I’ll eat some,” offered Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“So will I!” added Margy.</p>

<p>“That’s very kind of you!” laughed Rose
again, and then the six little Bunkers and their
mother started for the strawberry patch. The
berries grew wild on a warm, sunny hillside,
and soon little fingers were busy turning over
the green leaves to find the scarlet fruit
beneath.</p>

<p>Into the baskets the berries were dropped
one at a time. Wild strawberries are much
smaller than the cultivated variety you buy in
the market, and it takes longer to fill a basket
with the wild ones. But gradually the bottom
of the basket Mrs. Bunker carried was covered
with a layer of the delicious fruit. Then
she looked into the baskets of Margy and
Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“Is that all you’ve picked?” she asked, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
surprise, for Margy had three berries in her
basket and Mun Bun had two in his, and yet
they had been in the berry patch half an hour.
“Don’t you know how to find the berries, my
dears?” asked their mother. “See, you must
turn over the leaves——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Mother,” broke in Rose, first
asking pardon for interrupting, “but I guess
Margy and Mun Bun eat the berries as fast as
they pick them. That’s what they’ve been doing—eating
the berries, I saw them put only
a few in their baskets.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Mrs. Bunker, “we don’t
expect them to pick many. We older ones
will have to get you enough for your cake,
Rose.”</p>

<p>“I ate only about forty-’leven berries,”
confessed Margy.</p>

<p>“An’ I ate six-fourteen,” admitted Mun
Bun. “They is awful good, these berries is,
an’ maybe Rose wouldn’t make a cake, anyhow,
an’——”</p>

<p>“I see!” laughed Russ. “They were afraid
they wouldn’t get their share of berries if they
waited, so they’re taking them now.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, my dears,” said their mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
for Margy and Mun Bun did not like to be
laughed at. “Eat as many berries as you wish.
They are ripe and fresh and very tempting.
We’ll get enough for Rose’s cake, I think.”</p>

<p>So while the younger ones ate the lovely
fruit, the older ones dropped the berries they
picked into the baskets until they had a sufficient
quantity—more than two quarts.</p>

<p>Once, while they were picking, the six little
Bunkers heard a roaring, bellowing sound off
behind a second hill.</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe that’s the old bull who has gotten
loose—Ralph’s bull!” cried Violet, as she
ran toward her mother.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so,” Mrs. Bunker answered.
But the noise sounded again, very much like
the bellow of a bull.</p>

<p>“Russ, get a club and some stones!” cried
Rose. “There isn’t any fence here to jump
over. Get a stick and drive away the bull!”
Russ caught up a short club—not a very heavy
one if it was to be used against a bull. Mrs.
Bunker stood up and looked around. Then
she laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, children,” she said. “It
isn’t a bull at all. It’s the whistle of an engine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
on a distant train. There it goes!” and she
pointed to the railroad, about a mile off over
the hill. A train was going along, very
slowly, it seemed, but probably it was speeding
faster than it appeared to be. And as the
Bunkers looked they saw a puff of white steam
from the locomotive. A little later they heard
the whistle. When they had been stooping
down the whistle had sounded like the distant
bellow of a bull.</p>

<p>“I’m glad it wasn’t,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“If it had ‘a’ been I’d ‘a’ hit it with a club,”
boasted Russ.</p>

<p>“An’ I could throw a stone!” declared Mun
Bun.</p>

<p>“Mother, did you notice how funny the
whistle was?” asked Rose. “First we saw the
smoke puff up, and then we heard the sound.
Why was that?”</p>

<p>“Because light, or sight, travels faster than
sound,” said Mrs. Bunker. “You can see
something much quicker than you can hear it.
If you should ever stand far off and see a gun
shot off, you would first see the flash and the
smoke, and, some seconds later, you would
hear the report. Sight and sound travel in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
what are called waves, almost like the waves
of the ocean, except that the sound waves are
made of air instead of water. Light waves are
different from air or water waves, and travel
much faster—almost as fast as electricity.”</p>

<p>“And electricity is terribly fast,” said Russ.
“Once I took hold of a battery and as soon as
I touched the handles I felt a shock.”</p>

<p>After this the picking of strawberries went
on until enough had been gathered. Then
they all ate some and went home, and Rose
made the shortcake, Norah helping her.</p>

<p>“I’ll set the shortcake in the back pantry to
cool for supper,” said Norah, when Rose had
finished making it, and very proud the little
girl was.</p>

<p>The shortcake was put away and the little
Bunkers were wondering how next they could
have some fun when there came a knock on
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“I wonder who that can be?” said Norah.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="fs80">THE SHOE-LACE BOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Russ, who was nearest the door, went to
open it. Afterward Violet said she thought it
might be some of the neighbors coming to ask
for a piece of Rose’s strawberry shortcake.
Laddie said later that he thought it might be
Ralph come on the same sort of errand.</p>

<p>Well, it was a boy who had knocked on the
door, but it was not Ralph, the master of Jimsie,
the dog, nor was it any boy the Bunker
children had ever seen around Farmer Joel’s
place.</p>

<p>It was a “peddler boy,” as Violet called
him—a boy with dark hair, dark complexion,
and deep brown eyes, and he carried a pack on
his back and a box slung by a strap in front
of him.</p>

<p>“Shoe laces, collar buttons, suspenders,
needles, pins—anything to-day?” asked the
peddler boy, rattling out the words so quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
that Russ could hardly tell one from another.</p>

<p>“Wha—what’s that?” asked the bewildered
Russ.</p>

<p>“Want any shoe laces? Any collar buttons—needles—pins—suspenders—hooks
and
eyes—court plaster—pocket knives—any——”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t want anything to-day,” said
Norah, advancing to the door and looking out
over Russ’s head.</p>

<p>“How do you know you don’t want anything,
Lady?” asked the peddler boy with a
pert and rather smart manner. “I haven’t
told you all I carry yet. I have——”</p>

<p>“But I tell you we don’t want anything!”
insisted Norah. “I know what you have—notions—and
we don’t want any because we’re
only visiting here and——”</p>

<p>“I have baggage tags!” interrupted the boy.
“If you are only visiting you’ll want to send
your trunks back and you’d better put a tag
on. I’ll show you!” Quickly he opened the
box he carried, slung by a strap about his
neck. The other Bunker children, crowding
to the door, saw in the box many of the things
the boy had named—pins, needles, some combs
and brushes, and other things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>The boy took out a package of baggage
tags, each tag having a short piece of cord attached
to it. These he held out to Norah, at
the same time saying:</p>

<p>“Use these and you never lose any baggage.”</p>

<p>“We take our baggage in the automobile,”
said Rose.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe a piece might fall out and if
it had a tag on it you wouldn’t lose it,” said
the boy, who spoke in rather a strange manner,
like a foreigner who had recently learned
English.</p>

<p>“I tell you we don’t want anything,” said
Norah, speaking a little more sharply.</p>

<p>“What about some letter paper and envelopes?”
persisted the boy. “You could write,
couldn’t you, and I sell ’em cheap——”</p>

<p>“No! No! We don’t want a thing, I tell
you!” and Norah spoke very sharply and began
to close the door.</p>

<p>“Huh, I guess it wouldn’t be much good to
sell you letter paper,” sneered the boy.
“You’re so mean you haven’t any friends
that’d want you to write!”</p>

<p>The door was closed but the words came
through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Say,” cried Russ, as he struggled to open
the door again, “if you talk like that to our
Norah——”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” laughed the good-natured
cook. “Such peddlers aren’t worth answering.
He’s angry because we didn’t buy something.
If he had been polite about it I might,
but he was too——”</p>

<p>“Too smart! That’s what he was!” finished
Rose, and that about described the shoe-lace
peddler.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Norah and the six little
Bunkers could hear him muttering to himself
as he walked away, but as Daddy Bunker just
then called the children to give them some
picture papers that had come by mail, they
forgot all about the impolite lad.</p>

<p>The Bunker children had fun looking
through the illustrated magazine and they
were rather glad to sit down and do this, for
picking the strawberries on the distant hill
had been rather tiring.</p>

<p>“I wish supper would soon be ready. I
want some of Rose’s shortcake,” remarked
Violet.</p>

<p>“It looked good,” returned Russ. “If it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
tastes half as good as it looks, it will be great!”</p>

<p>“I hope it will be good,” said Rose
modestly.</p>

<p>Six hungry little Bunkers sat down to the
supper table, and pretty soon there were no
more six hungry little Bunkers, for they ate
so many of the good things Norah cooked for
them that they were no longer hungry. But
there was still six little Bunkers, and they
were anxious to try Rose’s strawberry shortcake.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring it in to the table and Rose can
cut it,” said Norah.</p>

<p>She went to the pantry, but in less than half
a minute she came hurrying back with a
strange look on her face.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Daddy Bunker.
“Did you see a ghost, Norah?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. But—but—didn’t we put the
strawberry shortcake in the pantry?” she
asked Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Yes, surely,” was the answer. “I saw you
put it there to cool.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t there now!” exclaimed
Norah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, did some one take my lovely strawberry
shortcake?” sighed Rose.</p>

<p>“Russ, you aren’t playing any of your
jokes, are you?” asked his father, somewhat
sternly. “Did you take Rose’s shortcake and
hide it, just for fun?”</p>

<p>“No, sir! I never touched her shortcake.
I didn’t see it after Norah put it away!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a look,” said Mrs. Bunker. “Perhaps
Farmer Joel went in and set it on a
higher shelf.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” declared Mr. Todd. “I
never go into the pantry. That isn’t my part
of the house. And Adam didn’t touch the
shortcake, I’m sure. Did you?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. North shook his head.</p>

<p>“I like strawberry shortcake,” he said, “but
I’d never think of playing a joke with the one
Rose baked.”</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Bunker came back from
the pantry whither she had gone to make a
search.</p>

<p>“The shortcake isn’t there,” she said.</p>

<p>“Who could have taken it?” asked Norah.</p>

<p>“Maybe Jimsie!” suggested Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“No dog could reach up to the high sill of
the pantry window,” said Mrs. Bunker. “I
can see where the cake was placed on the sill,
for a little of the red juice ran out and made
a stain. The cake was lifted out of the window,
perhaps by some one from the outside.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a look!” exclaimed Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>He hurried outside to the pantry window
at the back of the house, followed by Russ,
Rose and the others. Supper was over except
for the dessert, and this finish of the meal
was to have been the shortcake. With this
gone—well, there wasn’t any dessert, that’s
all!</p>

<p>Mr. Bunker looked carefully under the
window, motioning to the others to keep back
so they would not trample in any footprints
that might remain in the soft ground. Carefully
Mr. Bunker looked and then he said:</p>

<p>“Some boy went there, reached in and took
the cake.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think it was a boy?”
asked Farmer Joel.</p>

<p>“Because of the size of the footprints.
They are not much larger than those Russ
would make.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder if Ralph was here?” murmured
Rose.</p>

<p>“No, I saw Ralph and his Jimsie dog going
over to Woodport right after dinner,” remarked
Adam North. “He said he was going
to be gone all day. Ralph didn’t take the
cake, nor did his dog Jimsie. Of that I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>“Then I know who it was!” suddenly exclaimed
Russ.</p>

<p>“Who?” they all asked.</p>

<p>“That peddler, the shoe-lace boy!” Russ
answered. “He was mad because we wouldn’t
buy anything, and he sneaked around and took
Rose’s shortcake off the window sill.”</p>

<p>Russ started toward the road.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“I’m going to chase after that shoe-lace boy
and make him give back the strawberry shortcake!”
cried Russ.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SHORTCAKE COMES BACK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before his father could stop him Russ had
run out on the porch. Laddie, too, left his
seat and started after his brother.</p>

<p>“Charles!” exclaimed Mrs. Bunker, “are
you going to let them go after that boy? He’s
big and might hurt them!”</p>

<p>“I guess Russ and Laddie together are a
match for that mean little peddler,” answered
Mr. Bunker. “But perhaps I’d better trail
along after them to see that they don’t get
hurt,” he added, getting up. “I hardly believe,
however, that they can catch that peddler.
He must be a long way off by this time.”</p>

<p>The two oldest Bunker boys were already
out in the road, looking up and down for a
sight of the shoe-lace peddler.</p>

<p>“Which way do you think he went, Russ?”
asked Laddie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the answer, for the boy
who it was thought had taken Rose’s strawberry
shortcake was not in sight. “But here
comes a man driving a team,” Russ went on.
“We’ll ask him if he saw this peddler down
the road.”</p>

<p>A neighboring farmer who was known to
Russ and Laddie just then approached
Farmer Joel’s house. Mr. Bunker, who was
slowly following his two sons, heard Russ
ask:</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of a shoe-lace peddler
down the road, Mr. Harper?”</p>

<p>“A shoe-lace peddler?” repeated Mr.
Harper. “Um, let me see now. Yes, I did
pass a boy with a pack on his back down by
the white bridge,” he answered.</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow!” exclaimed Russ.
“Come on, Laddie!”</p>

<p>“Charles,” said Mrs. Bunker, following her
husband out to the front gate, the other little
Bunkers trailing along behind, “do you really
think you ought to let them go?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any harm in it,” he answered.
“In the first place, I don’t believe Russ and
Laddie will catch that boy. But if they do,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
I’ll follow along to see that he doesn’t harm
them.”</p>

<p>“And if you need help call on us!” chuckled
Farmer Joel, as he and Adam North began to
do the night chores around the place.
Farmer Joel called it “doing his chores,”
when he locked the barn, saw that the hen-house
was fastened, and got in kindling for
the morning fire.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess there’ll be no trouble,” said
Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>Rose came hurrying out toward the front
gate, running ahead of her father.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Rose?” he asked her.
“I’m going with Russ and Laddie,” she
answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Rose,” said Mrs. Bunker. “I don’t
believe I would.”</p>

<p>“Yes, please!” pleaded Rose. “It was my
shortcake that peddler boy took, and I want
to bring it back. Please let me go!”</p>

<p>She seemed so much in earnest about it, and
looked so disappointed when her mother had
spoken of keeping her back, that Daddy
Bunker said:</p>

<p>“All right, run along. But don’t get hurt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Your mother and I will come along after
you.”</p>

<p>So it was that Russ, Laddie, and Rose hurried
down the country road after the peddler
who it was suspected had taken the cake.
Trailing after them, but coming more slowly,
were Mr. and Mrs. Bunker and the other
little Bunkers.</p>

<p>“What shall we do to him, Russ, when we
catch him?” asked Rose, as she jogged along
beside her older brother.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask him for the cake, that’s what I’ll
do.”</p>

<p>“And if he doesn’t give it up?”</p>

<p>“Then—then—I—I’ll thump him!” exclaimed
Russ, doubling up his fists.</p>

<p>“And I’ll help,” offered Laddie excitedly.</p>

<p>“We-ell, perhaps,” said Rose doubtfully.
It sounded to her a little too boastful.</p>

<p>The white bridge which Mr. Harper had
spoken of was about half a mile down the
road from Farmer Joel’s place, and soon after
making a turn in the highway Russ, Rose, and
Laddie saw the structure.</p>

<p>“I see some one fishing off the bridge,” remarked
Russ. “Maybe it’s that boy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>As the three Bunkers came nearer they
could see a boy sitting on the bridge railing,
holding a pole from which a line was dangling
in the water that flowed under the
bridge. And when the children drew a little
nearer they could make out that the fisher was
the shoe-lace peddler boy.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time that they recognized
him, the boy knew them, and he sprang
down from the bridge railing, began winding
up his line and started to pick up his box and
basket.</p>

<p>“Here, you! Wait a minute!” ordered
Russ.</p>

<p>“I don’t have to wait!” sneered the peddler.
“There’s no fish here, so why should I wait?”</p>

<p>“You’ve got something that we want!” went
on Rose, drawing nearer with Russ, while
Laddie began looking about for a club or a
stone.</p>

<p>“You said you didn’t want anything,”
grumbled the peddler. “I was up by your
house, and you wouldn’t buy any shoe laces
nor collar buttons yet, so why should it be you
come running after me now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“Because you have my shortcake!” burst out
Rose indignantly. “You took my strawberry
shortcake and I want it back.”</p>

<p>“I should have taken your shortcake, little
girl?” cried the boy, as if greatly surprised.
“You are mistaken! Why should you say I
have your shortcake?”</p>

<p>“Because you were the only one around the
house after the shortcake was set in the pantry
window to cool,” said Russ boldly. “And
my father saw your footprints under the
window.”</p>

<p>“And my father’s coming, and so is my
mother, and if you don’t give my sister back
her cake they’ll have you arrested!” threatened
Laddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, your father and mother—they is coming,
are they?” asked the boy, who did not
speak very good English. He was not quite
so bold and defiant as at first.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re coming,” said Russ, looking
over his shoulder down the road. “But if you
give up the shortcake there won’t be any
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Why should I have your cake?” cried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
boy. “Look you and see—it is not in mine
pockets!” He turned one or two pockets inside
out as he stood on the bridge.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Just as if you could put my big
strawberry shortcake in your pocket!” scoffed
Rose.</p>

<p>“It’s in your box or your basket, that’s
where it is!” declared Laddie. And then another
thought came to him as he added: “Unless
you’ve eaten it!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Rose, in distress at the thought
of her good strawberry shortcake having been
eaten by the shoe-lace peddler.</p>

<p>“I should eat your cake? No! No!” cried
the boy, raising his hand in the air over his
head.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to have a look in your
basket!” threatened Russ, walking toward the
place on the bridge where the peddler boy
had set down the things in which he carried
his wares.</p>

<p>“Don’t you touch my basket!” yelled the
peddler. “If you open it I shall a blow give
you on the nose!”</p>

<p>He said it in such a funny, excited way that
Rose had to laugh, and Russ said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>“I can give you a hit on the nose, too!”</p>

<p>“You don’t dast!” sneered the peddler.</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare!” insisted Russ.</p>

<p>“And I’ll help him!” added Laddie, who
had found a stick.</p>

<p>The peddler boy, who was almost a head
taller than Russ, closed his fists and was walking
toward the three Bunker children. Rose
felt her heart beating very fast. She looked
back down the road and saw her father and
mother coming, followed by Margy, Mun
Bun, and Violet.</p>

<p>“Oh, here come daddy and mother!” cried
Rose.</p>

<p>Instantly a change came over the peddler
boy. His fists unclenched and he smiled in a
sickly, frightened sort of way.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, maybe your shortcake did get
in my box by mistake,” he said. “I takes me a
look and see.”</p>

<p>Quickly he opened his box, and there,
wrapped in a clean paper, was the strawberry
shortcake Rose had made.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the little girl, in delight. “Oh,
my shortcake has come back!”</p>

<p>“Huh! I thought you said you didn’t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
it!” exclaimed Russ, as the peddler lad lifted
out the cake and handed it to Rose.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe I make a mistake and forget,”
said the other.</p>

<p>“Huh, I guess you forgot on purpose!”
declared Laddie.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. and Mrs. Bunker had
come up. They saw that Rose had her shortcake
again.</p>

<p>“Look here, young man,” said Mr. Bunker
sternly to the peddler, “you mustn’t go about
the country stealing things, you know! You
may land in jail if you try that again.”</p>

<p>“It was all a mistake, I tell you!” said the
shoe-lace peddler, who was really older in experience
than a boy of his years should have
been. “It was a mistake.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—a mistake?” asked
Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Well, I saw the shortcake on the window,
and I thought maybe it was to be thrown
away, so I picked it up. I didn’t know anybody
wanted it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know now,” said Mr. Bunker
grimly. “And you had better not try any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
more tricks like that. Are you sure you didn’t
take anything more by mistake?”</p>

<p>“No, I take nothing more,” answered the
boy sullenly, as he fastened his box again,
and, slinging that and his basket of wares over
his shoulder, away he walked. He was quite
angry at being caught, it appeared.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad I got my shortcake back!”
cried Rose. “Now we can eat it when we get
back to the house.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it was kept clean?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p>But they need not have worried on that
score. Whatever else he was, the peddler boy
seemed clean, and he had wrapped a clean
paper about the short cake before putting it
in his box. To be sure some of the strawberries
on top were crushed and a little of their
red juice had run down the sides of the cake.</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t matter, ’cause we got to
smash it a lot more when we eat it,” said
Laddie.</p>

<p>Which, of course, was perfectly true.</p>

<p>So Rose’s shortcake came back to Farmer
Joel’s and they sat down to the table again and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
ate it. Dessert was a little late that evening,
but it was liked none the less.</p>

<p>“Busy day to-morrow, children!” said
Farmer Joel, as the six little Bunkers went up
to bed.</p>

<p>“What doing?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“Getting in the hay!” was the answer.
“Those who can’t help can ride on the hay
wagon.”</p>

<p>There were whoops of delight from the six
little Bunkers.</p>

<p>“Could I drive the horses?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see about that,” answered
Farmer Joel slowly.</p>

<p>“I want to ride on the rake that makes the
hay into heaps like Eskimo houses,” announced
Laddie.</p>

<p>“You’d better not do that,” his mother said.
“You might fall off and get raked up with
the hay.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look after them, and so will Adam
North!” chuckled Farmer Joel. “So to bed
now, all of you. Up bright and early! We
must get the hay in before it rains!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br>
<span class="fs80">AN EXCITING RIDE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Very seldom did the six little Bunkers need
any one to call them to get them out of bed.
Generally they were up before any one else
in Farmer Joel’s house. The morning when
the hay was to be gotten in was no exception.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as Norah had the fire started
and breakfast on the way, Russ, Rose and the
others were impatient to start for the hay
field.</p>

<p>“Why does he have to get the hay in before
it rains?” asked Violet of her father, remembering
what Farmer Joel had said the night
before.</p>

<p>“Because rain spoils hay after it has been
cut and is lying in the field ready to be
brought in,” answered Mr. Todd, who heard
Vi’s question. “Once hay is dried, it should
be brought in and stored away in the barn as
soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“After it is raked up and made into cocks,
or Eskimo houses, as Laddie calls them, if it
should rain we’d have to scatter the hay all
over again to dry it out. For if it were to be
put away in the haymow when wet the hay
would get mouldy and sour, and the horses
would not eat it.”</p>

<p>“Also if the hay gets rained on after it is
cut and dried, and while it is still scattered
about the field, it must be turned over so the
wet part will dry in the hot sun before it can
be hauled in. We have had several days of
hot weather and my hay is fine and dry now.
That’s why I am anxious to get it into the
barn in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we had better hurry,” said
Adam North who, with a couple of other
hired men, was to help get in Farmer Joel’s
hay. “We’re likely to have thunder showers
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Then we must all move fast!” exclaimed
Daddy Bunker, who liked to work on the
farm almost as much as did Adam and Mr.
Todd.</p>

<p>The day before the hay had been raked into
long rows by Adam, who rode a large two-wheeled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
rake drawn by a horse. The rake
had long curved prongs, or teeth, which
dragged on the ground pulling the hay with
them. When a large enough pile of hay had
been gathered, Adam would press on a spring
with one foot and the teeth of the rake would
lift up over the long row of dried grass. This
was kept up until the field was filled with
many rows of hay, like the waves on the seashore.</p>

<p>Then men went about piling the hay into
cocks, or cone-shaped piles, which, as Laddie
said, looked like the igloos of the Eskimos.
Now all that remained to be done was to load
the hay on a big, broad wagon and cart it to
the barn.</p>

<p>Laddie was a bit disappointed because all
the hay was raked up, for he wanted to ride on
the big machine which did this work. But
Farmer Joel said:</p>

<p>“We always have a second raking after we
draw in the hay, for a lot of fodder falls off
and is scattered about. You shall ride on the
rake when we go over the field for the second
time.”</p>

<p>So Laddie felt better, and he was as jolly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
as any of the six little Bunkers when they rode
out to the field on the empty wagon. Once
the field was reached there was a busy time.
There was little the children could do, for
loading hay is hard work, fit only for big,
strong men.</p>

<p>But Russ, Rose and the others watched
Adam, Farmer Joel, their father, and the two
hired men dig their shiny pitchforks deep
into a hay cock. Sometimes two men, each
with a fork, would lift almost a whole cock
up on the wagon at once. When one man did
it alone he took about half the cock at a time.</p>

<p>As the hay was loaded on the wagon, which
was fitted with a rick, going over the wheels,
the pile of dried grass on the vehicle became
higher and higher. So high it was, at last,
that the men could hardly pitch hay up on it.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll call this a load,” said Farmer
Joel, as he looked up at the sky. “The road is
a bit rough and if we put on too much we’ll
have an upset. Adam, I think you’re right,”
he went on. “We’ll have thunder showers
this afternoon. Have to hustle, boys, to get
the hay in!”</p>

<p>When the horses were ready to haul the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
load back to the barn, to be stored away in the
mow, the six little Bunkers were put up on
top of the load to ride.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is lovely!” cried Rose.</p>

<p>“Like being on a hundred feather beds!”
added Russ.</p>

<p>“And you don’t feel the jounces at all!”
added Laddie, for as the wagon went over
rough places in the field the children were
only gently bounced up and down, and not
shaken about as they would have been had
there been no hay on the wagon.</p>

<p>But the rough field caused one little accident
which, however, harmed no one.</p>

<p>The first load of hay was almost out of the
field when, as it approached the bars, Mun
Bun suddenly yelled:</p>

<p>“I’m slippin’! I’m slippin’!”</p>

<p>And Margy followed with a like cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m fallin’ off!” she shouted.</p>

<p>And, surely enough, Russ and Rose also felt
the top of the load of hay beginning to slip to
one side. Adam North was riding with the
children, Farmer Joel and Daddy Bunker
having remained in the field, while one hired
man drove the team of horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“I guess they didn’t load this hay evenly,”
said Adam. “Part of it is going to slip off.
But don’t be frightened, children,” he said
kindly. “You can’t get hurt falling with a
load of hay.”</p>

<p>Just as Adam finished speaking part of the
top of the load slid off the wagon and fell into
the field, and with it fell the six little Bunkers
and Adam himself.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” screamed Margy and Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” ordered Russ. “You won’t
get hurt!”</p>

<p>“Look out for the pitchforks—they’re
sharp!” warned Rose.</p>

<p>Laddie and Violet laughed with glee as
they felt themselves sliding.</p>

<p>Down in a heap went the hay, the six little
Bunkers and Adam. The hay was so soft it
was like falling in a bed of feathers. The
man sitting in front to drive the horses did not
slide off.</p>

<p>“All over! No damage!” cried Adam,
with a laugh, as he leaped up and picked the
smallest of the little Bunkers from the pile of
hay. “But we’ll have to load the hay back
on the wagon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>This was soon done, and once more the
merry party started for the barn, which was
reached without further accident.</p>

<p>Farmer Joel had many things on his place
to save work. Among these was a hay fork
which could pick up almost half a load of hay
at once and raise it to the mow.</p>

<p>A hay fork, at least one kind, looks like a
big letter U turned upside down. The two
arms are made of iron, and from their lower
ends prongs come out to hold the hay from
slipping off the arms.</p>

<p>A rope, running through a pulley is fastened
to the curved part of the U, and a horse,
pulling on the ground end of the rope, hoists
into the air a big mass of hay.</p>

<p>The wagon was driven under the high barn
window and from a beam overhead the hay
fork was lowered. Adam North plunged the
two sharp arms deep into the springy, dried
grass.</p>

<p>All but Russ had gotten down off the load
of hay to wait for the ride back to the field.
But Russ remained there. He wanted to see
how the hay fork worked.</p>

<p>So when Adam plunged the arms into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
fodder Russ was near by. Adam pulled on
the handle that shot the prongs out from the
arms to hold the hay from slipping off as the
fork was raised.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Russ did a daring thing.
Seeing the mass of hay rising in the air, pulled
by the horse on the ground below, the boy
made a grab for the bunch of dried grass. He
caught it, clung to it and up in the air he went,
on an exciting and dangerous ride.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at Russ! Look at Russ!” cried
Rose.</p>

<p>“Hi there, youngster, what are you doing?”
shouted Adam.</p>

<p>“I—I’m getting a ride!” Russ answered.
But his voice had a frightened tone in it as he
swung about and looked down below. He
began to feel dizzy.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">OFF ON A PICNIC</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While Russ swung to and fro in the mass
of hay lifted by the hay fork and was kept
over the load itself there was little danger. If
he fell he would land on the hay in the wagon.</p>

<p>But the hay fork had to swing to one side,
when high up in the air, so the hay could be
placed in the window opening into the storage
mow. And it was this part of Russ’s ride that
was dangerous.</p>

<p>The man on the ground, who had charge of
the horse that was hitched to the pulley rope,
knew nothing of what was going on above
him, for the load of hay was so large that it
hid Russ and the fork from sight. But this
man heard the shout of Adam, and he called
up:</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?”</p>

<p>“No! No!” quickly answered Adam, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
he feared if the horse stopped the shock might
throw Russ from his hold. “Keep on, Jake!”
he called to the hired man. “You’ll have to
hoist a boy up as well as a fork full of hay.
Hold on tight there, Russ!” Adam warned the
Bunker lad.</p>

<p>“I will,” Russ answered. He was beginning
to wish that he had not taken this dangerous
ride. It was done on the impulse of
the moment. He had seen the mass of hay
being lifted with the fork and he felt a desire
to go up with it—to get a ride in the air. So
he made a grab almost before he thought.</p>

<p>Up and up went the fork full of hay with
Russ on it. Now he was swung out and away
from the wagon, and was directly over the
bare ground, thirty or forty feet below. In
the barn window of the mow overhead a man
looked out.</p>

<p>“What’s this you’re sending me?” called
this man to Adam.</p>

<p>“It’s Russ! Grab him when he gets near
enough to you,” Adam answered.</p>

<p>“I will,” said the man who was “mowing
away,” as the work of storing the hay in the
barn is called.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Higher and higher up went Russ, while
Rose and the other little Bunkers on the
ground below gazed at him in mingled fright
and envy.</p>

<p>“Will he fall and be killed?” asked Vi.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. Oh, no! Of course not!”
exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>A moment later the fork load of hay with
Russ clinging to it, one hand on the lifting
rope, swung within reach of the man in the
mow window. Russ was caught, pulled inside
to safety, and as he sank down on the
pile of hay within the barn the man said:</p>

<p>“You’d better not do that again!”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” promised Russ, with a little
shiver of fear and excitement.</p>

<p>Rose and the other children breathed more
easily now, and Adam North, wiping the
sweat from his forehead, murmured:</p>

<p>“You never know what these youngsters are
going to do next!”</p>

<p>Back to the hay field went the empty wagon,
the six little Bunkers riding on it. The trip
back was not as comfortable as the one on the
load of hay had been. For the wagon was
rickety and the road was rough and jolty. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the six little Bunkers had a jolly time, just the
same.</p>

<p>The men were working fast now, and
Daddy Bunker was helping them, for dark
clouds in the west and distant muttering of
thunder seemed to tell of a coming storm, and
Farmer Joel did not want his hay to get wet.</p>

<p>Another big load was taken to the barn, no
upset happening this time. And you may be
sure Adam made certain that Russ did not
cling to the hay fork.</p>

<p>After three loads had been put away most
of the hay was in. Scattered about the field,
however, were little piles and wisps of the
fodder—perhaps half a load in all—and this
must be raked up by the big horse rake.</p>

<p>“Oh, may I have a ride?” cried Laddie,
when he saw the machine being brought out
from a corner of the rail fence where it had
been standing.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll give you each a ride in turn,”
kindly offered Adam North, who was to drive
the horse hitched to the big rake. And as
Laddie had asked first he was given the first
ride, sitting on the seat beside Adam.</p>

<p>The curved iron teeth of the rake gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
up a mass of hay until they could hold no
more. Then Adam “tripped” it, as the operation
is called. The teeth rose in the air and
passed over the mass of hay which was left on
the ground.</p>

<p>Working in this way, more hay was raked
up until there were several windrows and cocks
to be loaded upon the wagon. As a special
favor Russ and Rose were allowed to pitch
small forkfuls of the hay on the wagon. And
when all the dried grass had been gathered
up the children piled on and rode to the barn
for the last time.</p>

<p>“Hurray! Hurray! Hurray for the hay!”
they sang most merrily.</p>

<p>“And it’s a good thing we got it in to-day,”
said Farmer Joel, with a chuckle, as the last
forkful was raised to the mow. “For here
comes the rain!”</p>

<p>And down pelted the big drops. There was
not much thunder and lightning, but the rain
was very hard and the storm pelted and rumbled
all night.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing I got in my hay,” said
Farmer Joel, as he went to bed that night.
“Now I can sleep in peace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>For there is nothing more worrying to a
farmer than to hear it rain, knowing it is
spoiling his hay. Hay, once wet, is never
quite so good as that which has not been
soaked.</p>

<p>Though it rained all night, the sun came
out the next day, and the six little Bunkers
could play about and have fun. Russ and
Laddie were glad of the storm, for the rain
had made the brook higher, and water was
now for the first time running over the little
dam they had made so their water wheel
could be turned.</p>

<p>“She’ll splash like anything now!” cried
Laddie, as he and his brother hastened down
to the brook.</p>

<p>The water wheel was made of some flat
pieces of wood fastened together and set in a
frame work. The water, spouting over the
dam, fell on the blades of the paddle wheel
and turned it. On the axle of the wheel was
a small, round pulley, and around this there
was a string, or a belt, running to a small mill
that the boys had made. It had taken them
quite a while to do this.</p>

<p>“Now watch her whizz!” cried Russ to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
brothers and sisters, who had gathered on the
bank of the brook.</p>

<p>The water wheel was shoved back so the
overflow from the dam would strike the paddles.
Around they went, turning the pulley,
moving the string belt, and also turning the
wheel of the “mill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t that fine!” exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>“Could I have a ride on it?” Mun Bun
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Hardly!” laughed Russ. “If you sat on it
the wheel would break.”</p>

<p>“And you’d get all wet!” added Rose.</p>

<p>The six little Bunkers had much fun that
day, and more good times were ahead of them,
for that evening when they made ready for
bed, tired but happy, their mother said:</p>

<p>“To-morrow we are going on a picnic to the
woods.”</p>

<p>“A really, truly picnic?” Vi wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“With things to eat?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said his mother. “Now off to bed
with you! Up early, and we’ll have a fine
picnic in the woods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>You may be sure that not one of the six little
Bunkers overslept the next day. Bright
and early they were up, and soon they started
for the picnic grounds in the big hay wagon,
on which some straw had been scattered to
make soft seats.</p>

<p>“I wonder if anything will happen to-day?”
said Rose to Russ, as they rode off with their
lunches.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I mean anything like an adventure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, maybe we’ll find a—snake!” and Russ
laughed as he saw his sister jump, for Rose
did not like snakes.</p>

<p>“You’re a horrid boy!” she murmured.</p>

<p>But an adventure quite different from finding
a snake happened to the six little
Bunkers.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE ICE CAVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Along the road, through pleasant fields,
and into the woods rumbled the big farm hay
wagon, driven by Adam North. In the
wagon sat the six little Bunkers with their
father and mother and Farmer Joel. For
Farmer Joel had decided that, after the haymaking,
he was entitled to a holiday. So he
stopped work and went on the picnic with the
six little Bunkers.</p>

<p>“How much farther is it to the picnic
grounds?” asked Vi, after they had ridden for
perhaps half an hour.</p>

<p>“Not very far now,” answered Farmer Joel.</p>

<p>“Is it a nice picnic grounds?” went on the
little girl who always asked questions. “And
is there——”</p>

<p>“Now, Vi,” interrupted her mother, “suppose
you wait until we get there and you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
see what there is to see. You mustn’t tire
Farmer Joel by asking so many questions.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only wanted to ask just one thing
more,” begged Vi.</p>

<p>“Go ahead. What is it?” chuckled the
good-natured farmer.</p>

<p>“Is there a swing in the picnic woods?”
asked Vi, after a moment’s pause to decide
which question was the most important.</p>

<p>“Well, if there isn’t we can put one up, for
I brought a rope along,” answered Adam
North. He liked to see the six little Bunkers
have fun as much as the children loved to
play.</p>

<p>“Oh, a swing! Goodie!” cried Violet.</p>

<p>“I want to swing in it!” exclaimed Mun
Bun.</p>

<p>“So do I!” added Margy.</p>

<p>“I can see where there’s going to be trouble,
with only one swing,” murmured Daddy
Bunker, smiling at his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, they can take turns,” she said.</p>

<p>The wagon was now going through the
woods. On either side were green trees with
low-hanging branches, some of which met in
an arch overhead, drooping down so far that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
the children could reach up and touch the
leaves with their hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just lovely here,” murmured Rose,
who liked beautiful scenery.</p>

<p>“I see something that’s lovelier,” said Russ.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Rose. “I don’t see anything.
You can’t get much of a view down
here under the trees, but it’s beautiful just the
same.”</p>

<p>“Here’s the view I was looking at,” said
Russ, with a laugh, and he pointed to the piles
of lunch boxes and baskets in the front part of
the hay wagon. “That’s a better view than
just trees, Rose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you funny boy!” she laughed. “Always
thinking of something to eat! Don’t you
ever think of something else?”</p>

<p>“Yes, right after I’ve had something to eat
I think of when it’s going to be time to eat
again,” chuckled Russ.</p>

<p>Deeper into the woods went the picnic
wagon. The six little Bunkers were talking
and laughing among themselves, and Farmer
Joel was speaking to Mr. and Mrs. Bunker
and Adam about something that had happened
in the village that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly there was a cry from the children,
who were in the rear of the wagon, sprawled
about in the straw.</p>

<p>“Laddie’s gone!” exclaimed Rose.</p>

<p>“Did he fall out?” asked Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“No, it looks more as if he fell <em>up</em>!”
shouted Russ.</p>

<p>And that, indeed, is almost what happened.
For, looking back, Mr. and Mrs. Bunker, saw
Laddie hanging by his hands to the branch of
a tree he had grasped as the wagon passed
beneath it. The little fellow was swinging
over the roadway, the wagon having passed
from beneath him.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Laddie! I’ll come back and get
you!” shouted Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“In mischief again!” murmured Russ.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” called Adam, bringing the horses
to a halt.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Laddie! I’ll come and get you!”
called Mr. Bunker again, as he leaped from
the hay wagon.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t hold on!” gasped Laddie. “My—my
hands are slipping!”</p>

<p>The green branch was slowly bending over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
and Laddie’s hands were slipping from it.
Then, when he could keep his grasp no longer,
he let go, and down to the ground he fell, feet
first.</p>

<p>Luckily Laddie was only a short distance
above the ground when he slipped from the
branch, so he did not have far to fall. He
was only jarred and shaken a little bit—not
hurt at all.</p>

<p>“Laddie, why did you do that?” his father
asked him, when he had reached the little
fellow and picked him up. As Mr. Bunker
carried Laddie back to the waiting wagon
Russ remarked:</p>

<p>“I guess he thought maybe he could pull a
tree up by the roots when he caught hold of
the branch like that.”</p>

<p>“I did not!” exclaimed Laddie. “I just
wanted to pull off a whip for Mun Bun to
play horse with. But when I got hold of the
branch I forgot to let go and it lifted me right
out of the wagon.”</p>

<p>“It’s a mercy you weren’t hurt!” exclaimed
his mother.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” added Farmer Joel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
“It’s safer for you to think up riddles, Laddie,
than it is to do such tricks as that. Come
now, sit quietly in the wagon and think of a
riddle.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Laddie, as again he
took his place in the straw with the other little
Bunkers. But he did not ask any riddles for a
long time. Perhaps he had been too startled.
For surely it was rather a startling thing to
find himself dangling on a tree branch, the
wagon having gone out from under him.</p>

<p>However, in about fifteen minutes more
Laddie suddenly cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, now I know a riddle! Why is a
basket——”</p>

<p>But before he could say any more the other
children broke into cries of:</p>

<p>“There’s the picnic ground! There’s the
picnic ground!”</p>

<p>And, surely enough, they had reached the
grove in the woods where lunch was to be
eaten and games played.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day of sunshine, warm
and pleasant. Too warm, in fact, for Mrs.
Bunker had to call to the children several
times:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t run around too much and get overheated.
It is very warm, and seems to be getting
warmer.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Farmer Joel, as he looked at
the sky. “I think we’ll have a thunder shower
before the day is over.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t bring any umbrellas,” said Mrs.
Bunker.</p>

<p>“If it rains very hard we can take shelter in
a cave not far from here that I know of,” said
Mr. Todd.</p>

<p>“Oh, a cave! Where is it?” asked Russ,
who was lying down in the shade, having
helped put up the swing. “Could we go and
see it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“After a while, maybe,” promised Farmer
Joel.</p>

<p>Rose helped her mother spread out the good
things to eat. They found some flat stumps
which answered very well for tables, and after
Mun Bun and Margy and Laddie and Violet
had swung as much as was good for them,
and when they had raced about, playing
tag, hide-and-seek, and other games, the children
were tired enough to sit down in the
shade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll eat lunch after you rest a bit,” said
Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Ah, now comes the best part of the day!”
murmured Russ.</p>

<p>“Silly! Always thinking of something to
eat!” chided Rose. But she smiled pleasantly
at her brother.</p>

<p>How good the things eaten in the picnic
woods tasted! Even plain bread and butter
was almost as fine as cake, Laddie said. He
was trying to think of a riddle about this—a
riddle in which he was to ask when it was that
bread and butter was as good as cake—when
suddenly there came a low rumbling sound.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Margy.</p>

<p>“Thunder, I think,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Mun Bun, who was playing a little distance
away, came running in.</p>

<p>“I saw it lighten,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we’re in for a storm,” said
Farmer Joel.</p>

<p>The thunder became louder. The sun was
hidden behind dark clouds. The picnic
things were picked up. Mrs. Bunker was
glad lunch was over.</p>

<p>Then down pelted the rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Farmer Joel. “We’ll
take shelter in the cave!”</p>

<p>He led the way along a path through the
woods. The others followed, Mr. Bunker
carrying Mun Bun and Adam North catching
up Margy. The trees were so thick overhead
that not much rain fell on the picnic party.</p>

<p>“Here’s the cave!” cried Farmer Joel, pushing
aside some bushes. He showed a dark
opening among some rocks. In they rushed,
for it was a welcome shelter from the storm.</p>

<p>“Oh, but how cool it is in here,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Farmer Joel. “This is an
ice cave.”</p>

<p>“An ice cave!” exclaimed Russ. “Is there
really ice in here in the middle of summer?”</p>

<p>Before Farmer Joel could answer a terrific
crash of thunder seemed to shake the whole
earth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="fs80">A BIG SPLASH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There was silence in the dark cave of ice
following that big noise from the sky. Then
came a steady roar of sound.</p>

<p>“It’s raining cats and dogs outside,” said
Farmer Joel. “We got here just in time.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Margy began to whimper and
then she began to cry.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, my dear?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t like it in here!” sobbed Margy.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t, either, an’—an’ I’m goin’ to
cry, too!” snuffled Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“Oh, come, children!” exclaimed Mr.
Bunker, with a laugh. “Don’t be babies!
Why don’t you like it in here?”</p>

<p>“I—I’m ’fraid maybe we’ll be struck by
lightning,” whimpered Margy.</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” replied her mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“No lightning ever comes in here,” said
Farmer Joel. “Why, if lightning came in
there couldn’t be any ice. The lightning
would melt the ice, and it hasn’t done that.
I’ll show you a big pile of it back in the cave.
Of course no lightning ever comes in here!
Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>The thunder was not so loud now, and as no
lightning could be seen because the Bunkers
were far back in the dark cave, the two smallest
children stopped their crying.</p>

<p>“Is there really ice in here?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“It feels so,” said Rose, with a little shiver.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s ice here,” went on the farmer.
“It comes every year, and stays until after the
Fourth of July. Come, I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>Lighting a match and setting ablaze a stick
he picked up from the dry floor of the cave
in the rocks, Farmer Joel led the way toward
the back of the dark hole. The blazing stick
gave light like a torch.</p>

<p>It grew colder and colder the deeper they
went into the cave, and Mrs. Bunker, with a
little shiver, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It is cold in here!”</p>

<p>“We won’t stay very long,” said Mr. Todd.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
“I’ll just show the children the pile of ice and
then we’ll go back to the front part of the cave
where the air is warmer. This shower will
soon be over and we can go outside again.”</p>

<p>They walked on a little farther and suddenly
Rose cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, I see it! I see a big pile of ice!”</p>

<p>The light from Farmer Joel’s blazing stick
glittered on a sparkling mass of ice and snow
in the deepest, darkest part of the cave.</p>

<p>“Is it real?” asked Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“Touch it and see,” advised his father.</p>

<p>Mun Bun put his little hand on the
sparkling pile. He drew it quickly back with
a murmur of wonder.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s terribly cold!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It’s real ice, all right,” laughed Farmer
Joel.</p>

<p>“How does it get in here?” Russ asked.</p>

<p>“There is a hole in the roof of the cave—the
roof that is made of rocks,” explained the
farmer. “You can see where some water is
pouring in now from the rain.” The children
looked and saw drops falling on top of the
pile of ice.</p>

<p>“Not as much water comes in here in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
summer as in winter,” explained Farmer
Joel; “for now the holes in the rocky roof are
filled with bushes and leaves. But in the winter,
when the leaves dry out, there is quite an
opening. Rain and melted snow runs in and
it is so cold here that a big, solid chunk of ice
is frozen.”</p>

<p>“But what makes it stay here when summer
comes?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Because the warm sun cannot shine inside
the cave to melt the ice,” explained her father.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added Farmer Joel. “Some
years we can come here even in the middle of
August and chop out chunks of ice.”</p>

<p>“I should think you could make ice cream,”
said Russ.</p>

<p>“Sometimes we do,” replied Mr. Todd.</p>

<p>“Oh, could we do that now?” cried Rose
eagerly.</p>

<p>“We haven’t any freezer nor the things to
make ice cream with,” objected her mother.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we take some of the ice home in
the wagon?” Russ wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Yes, you could do that,” said Farmer Joel
kindly.</p>

<p>For a few minutes longer the six little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Bunkers remained looking at the big mass of
ice—ice in the middle of summer. Then as
the torch was burning out and as it was chilly
after the warm outdoors, Mrs. Bunker told
the children to go to the front of the cave.</p>

<p>“But we’ll come back and get some of the
ice to make ice cream,” stated Russ.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Farmer Joel.</p>

<p>As he had said, the storm did not last long.
Soon the black clouds rolled away, the thunder
and lightning ceased, and the sun came
out, warmer than before. Out of the ice cave
rushed the children, merrily shouting and
laughing.</p>

<p>“Be careful now!” called their mother.
“The woods are very wet!”</p>

<p>But dry places were found under thick
evergreen trees, and there the six little
Bunkers played until it was time to go home.</p>

<p>“And now for the ice!” cried Russ, as the
wagon was driven up close to the entrance to
the cave.</p>

<p>“I want to break off a chunk!” cried Mun
Bun.</p>

<p>But it was decided best not to let the smaller
children go into the ice cave while pieces were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
being broken off to take to the farmhouse for
ice cream. So Russ and Rose were the only
ones allowed to see Farmer Joel, Daddy
Bunker, and Adam North break off pieces of
ice with heavy sticks of wood. Out to the
wagon the chunks were carried. There they
were covered with straw to keep them from
melting too much.</p>

<p>“Now for some ice cream!” cried Russ, as
they drove home. “I don’t believe you could
find ice in the summer time in many places,
could you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” his father told him. “Not
every place has an ice cave, though they are
not as rare as you might suppose. Sometimes,
in deep, rocky glens where the sun seldom
shines, I have seen ice as late as the end of
May. But I never saw a real ice cave before.”</p>

<p>“A polar bear could live in that cave,
couldn’t he?” asked Mun Bun on the way
home.</p>

<p>“Yes, it might for a little while,” said
Farmer Joel, “but I guess it would miss the
ocean. Polar bears need salt water to swim
in, as well as ice chunks to keep them cool.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“I hope no polar bear comes to live in that
cave while we’re here,” remarked Margy.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, darling!” laughed her
mother. “None will.”</p>

<p>There was plenty of the ice left when the
farmhouse was reached. Russ and Laddie
took it from the wagon and cracked it in burlap
bags, while Farmer Joel brought out some
coarse salt with which to mix it. Salt always
causes ice to melt faster, and it is only when
ice melts and gives out the cold locked up in
it that ice cream can be made.</p>

<p>Norah soon had the freezer full of a mixture
of sugar, cream and some sliced bananas,
since the children liked that flavor, and in a
little while Russ and Laddie were turning the
handle.</p>

<p>By supper time the ice cream was frozen,
and for dessert they had a dainty dish made
from ice brought in the middle of summer
from the dark cave. The six little Bunkers
thought it quite wonderful.</p>

<p>The next day Rose saw Farmer Joel carrying
what seemed to be a pail of thick, yellow
sour cream out of the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>“What are you going to do with that?”
asked Rose. “Are you going to feed it to the
pigs?” For she had often seen sour milk
taken to the pen of the big and little squealers.</p>

<p>“Give this to the pigs? I guess not!”
laughed Farmer Joel. “This is rich, sour
cream, and if my sister were here she would
churn it into butter. But as she is gone I’m
taking it to my neighbor, Mr. Ecker. His
wife will churn it for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, couldn’t I churn?” asked Rose. “I’d
love to!”</p>

<p>Farmer Joel set the pail of cream down on
a chair and rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Churning is hard work,” he said. “Sometimes
it’s a long while before the butter comes.
Of course we have a churn, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get Russ to help me and we’ll take
turns churning!” cried Rose. “Please let me.”</p>

<p>And Farmer Joel did. He brought up the
dasher churn from the cellar. Norah scalded
it out with hot water, and when it was cool
the sour cream was put in it and the cover
made fast. Then Rose took hold of the handle
of the dasher, which was like the handle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
of a broom, and moved it up and down
through a hole in the cover, as Farmer Joel
told her to.</p>

<p>Chug! Chug! Ker-chug! went the churn
dasher, splashing up and down in the thick,
yellow cream. Some of it, in little golden
balls, came up on the handle of the dasher,
above the cover.</p>

<p>“That’s butter,” Rose told Mun Bun and
Margy, who were watching her.</p>

<p>Margy put out a chubby finger, got a yellow
dab and tasted it.</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t a bit like butter!” she said, disappointedly.</p>

<p>“It will be when it is salted,” her mother
told her.</p>

<p>When Rose grew tired Russ took a turn,
and so did Laddie and Violet, and soon the
dasher was so heavy that none of the children
could lift it.</p>

<p>“I guess the butter has come,” said Farmer
Joel. “Yes, there it is. Look!” he added as
he took off the cover, and the children saw
big golden yellow lumps floating about in
what was now white buttermilk, for all the
cream had been changed into butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“How are you going to get it out?” asked
Rose.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” answered Farmer Joel,
who had often watched his sister do this work.
He moved the flat dasher up and down, slowly
turning it the while, and in a minute or two
there was gathered on the top of the dasher
all the floating lumps of butter.</p>

<p>These were lifted out and put in a wooden
bowl and Norah “worked out” the buttermilk,
leaving, finally, a firm, yellow lump of
butter.</p>

<p>“There you are!” cried Farmer Joel.
“When it is salted you may eat some on your
bread for supper.”</p>

<p>And the six little Bunkers did, saying it
was the best they had ever tasted. Daddy
Bunker and his wife drank some of the buttermilk
left in the churn after the butter was
taken out. But when Russ tasted it he made
a funny face and cried:</p>

<p>“Sour! Ugh! Sour!”</p>

<p>“Of course!” laughed his mother. “Buttermilk
is always sour. But it is good for
you, and I like the taste of it.”</p>

<p>“You can have all of mine,” said Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“And I don’t want any, either,” Rose made
haste to say.</p>

<p>Thus it was that butter was made, and it
came out well except that, almost at the last
minute, Mun Bun took the plug out of the
bottom of the churn and let some of the buttermilk
run over the floor. But Norah soon
wiped it up.</p>

<p>The next day Russ decided that he would
make a larger mill for his water wheel in
the brook to turn, and Laddie offered to help
him. The two boys went down to the stream
with bits of wood, a hammer and nails, and
they were busy for some time. Mrs. Bunker
had taken the other children for a walk in
the forest not far away.</p>

<p>While Russ was working at the new mill
Laddie piled up stones and bits of sod on top
of the dam already built, to make it higher
so the water back of it would be deeper.</p>

<p>“The deeper the water is and the higher we
have the dam,” Russ explained to Laddie,
“the faster the wheel will turn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’ll be fine,” agreed Laddie, tugging
at a big stone to get it on top of the dam.</p>

<p>Russ was putting the new play mill in place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
and was getting ready to connect it to the
water wheel when suddenly he heard a big
splash up at the dam, which he could not see
plainly because a bush was in the way.</p>

<p>“What happened, Laddie?” asked Russ.
“Did you drop something in the water?”</p>

<p>“I—I dropped—my—<em>myself</em>—in!” gasped
Laddie. “Oh, Russ, I’m all the way—in!
I—I’m all—the—way—in!”</p>

<span class="fs80">A FIGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Russ sprang to his feet, knocking aside the
pieces of his mill in doing so, and rushed
around the bush to see what had happened to
Laddie. It was just as the smaller boy had
said—he had fallen in the deepest part of the
water back of the dam.</p>

<p>But, after all, it was not very deep, for the
brook was a small one. The water would
not have been over Laddie’s head if he stood
upright. But the trouble was that Laddie
had slipped as he was about to lift a heavy
stone on top of the dam, and had gone down
sideways.</p>

<p>“I’m coming! I’m coming!” Russ shouted,
as he saw Laddie floundering and struggling
in the water.</p>

<p>“I—I guess—blub—blub—glub-ub!” was
what Laddie answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>He started to say that he guessed he could
get out by himself, when his foot slipped on
some mud at the bottom of the brook and his
face went under water.</p>

<p>“Oh, Laddie!” cried Russ in alarm.</p>

<p>But he need not have been worried, for
Laddie managed to get up on his feet again,
and by this time Russ was beside him, holding
out his hands to his small brother to help
him to shore.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” Russ asked, as Laddie,
gasping for breath and with water dripping
from every part of him, stood on the bank of
the brook.</p>

<p>“No, I—I’m not exactly <em>hurt</em>,” Laddie answered.
Then he smiled and said: “But
I’m awful <em>wet</em>!”</p>

<p>“I should say you were! And muddy, too!”
chuckled Russ. “It’s a good thing you had
your old clothes on. I guess mother won’t
scold much. She expects us to fall in once
or twice. I heard her tell Farmer Joel that.
How did it happen, Laddie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess that stone was too heavy for
me. I almost had it where I wanted it and
it began to slip away from me. I made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
grab for it and I slipped and I went down—and
in!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you went in all right,” laughed Russ.
“Well, come on up to the house and get on
dry things.”</p>

<p>“No,” objected Laddie.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked his brother. “Are you
afraid mother will scold?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. But what’s the use of
getting dry clothes on when maybe I’ll get
all wet again fixing the dam? As long as I’m
wet I might as well finish the dam, and then
we can work the water wheel.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe that is the best way,” agreed
Russ. “It won’t take long to fix the dam now,
and you might fall in again.”</p>

<p>And Laddie did. Once more, as he was
lifting a stone to the top of the dam, he slipped
and fell in, but this time he only laughed and
kept right on working. And when the dam
was finally built higher, so that more water
poured over to turn the wheel, Laddie went
to the house and put on dry clothes.</p>

<p>His mother, who had come back from the
woods, did not scold him when he told her
what had happened, but she made him wash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
the mud from his clothes and hang them
out to dry, since she said it was only
right that he should do this to save Norah
work.</p>

<p>Laddie and Russ had much fun playing at
the water wheel and with the new and larger
mill. Rose and the other children went to
look at the splashing mill wheel and thought
it very fine indeed.</p>

<p>“If I see that boy sneaking around here,
and if he throws stones at your mill, shall I
drive him off?” asked Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“What boy?” Russ wanted to know.</p>

<p>“That peddler boy who took Rose’s strawberry
shortcake,” Mun Bun replied.</p>

<p>“Why, have you seen him again?” asked
Mrs. Bunker, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him going along the road yesterday,”
Mun Bun said. “But he didn’t
come in and try to sell any shoe laces.”</p>

<p>“He’d better not come around here again!”
declared Russ, with flashing eyes as he
clenched his fists. “If he comes I—I’ll hit
him!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t fight, Russ,” his mother said.
“But I hardly believe it is the same boy. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
wouldn’t stay around here after being so bold
as to take Rose’s shortcake the way he did.
It must have been some other peddler, Mun
Bun.”</p>

<p>“No, it was the same one,” insisted the little
fellow, and later they found out that he was
right.</p>

<p>Two days after this a little girl who lived
down the road from Farmer Joel’s house invited
Rose, Violet, and Margy to come to a
party.</p>

<p>“It’s funny she didn’t invite us,” said Russ.</p>

<p>“She isn’t going to have any boys this
time,” Rose explained. “But maybe she will
next time, and then you can go.”</p>

<p>“Maybe next time we won’t want to!” answered
Russ. “Anyhow, we’re going fishing
now. Come on, Laddie!”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the other. “Fishing is
more fun, anyhow, than parties.”</p>

<p>“Can I come fishing?” asked Mun Bun.</p>

<p>As Russ and Laddie promised to look after
him, Mun Bun’s mother allowed the little fellow
to go with the other two boys. There
was a small stream, larger than the brook,
about half a mile away across Farmer Joel’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
fields, and toward that place Russ, Laddie,
and Mun Bun went in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Now be careful, Russ, that your brothers
don’t fall in and don’t let them get fish hooks
in their hands,” warned Mr. Bunker, for, to
his delight, Mun Bun was allowed to fish with
a real hook and not with a bent pin, with
which he never had any luck. This was to
be a real fishing party.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of them,” promised Russ.</p>

<p>Away went the boys over the fields toward
the little river, Russ merrily whistling. On
a shady, grassy bank, under a big buttonwood
tree, the boys sat down and cast their baited
hooks into the deep water of an eddy, where,
in the quiet pool, there were said to be large
fish.</p>

<p>Presently the cork on the line attached to
Russ’s pole began to bob up and down. Then
it went under water.</p>

<p>“You have a bite, Russ!” excitedly called
Laddie.</p>

<p>“I know I have! Keep still or you’ll scare
it away!”</p>

<p>Russ waited a moment longer. The cork
went away under.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“Now I have him!” cried Russ.</p>

<p>He pulled up his line. On the hook was
a good-sized fish which Russ landed back of
him on the grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I could get one!” sighed Laddie
enviously.</p>

<p>“Look at my cork! Look!” suddenly cried
Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“He’s got a bite, too!” cried Laddie. “Pull
in, Mun Bun! Pull in! I’ll help you!”</p>

<p>Laddie pulled out the little fellow’s line,
and, surely enough, Mun Bun had caught a
fish, not as large as the one Russ had landed,
but still Mun Bun was much delighted.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I’ll get one?” sighed Laddie.</p>

<p>He did a little later. Then Russ caught a
second one, and after a while Laddie said he
would go farther downstream to another
“hole” he knew of.</p>

<p>“The fish are biting good to-day,” Russ said,
as he baited his hook and threw it in again.</p>

<p>A little later a shadow fell on the grass behind
Russ and Mun Bun. Russ turned around
and saw—that ugly peddler boy who had
taken the shortcake Rose had baked!</p>

<p>“Huh!” sneered the peddler, as he walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
up with a pole in his hands. “What right
you fellows got to fish here?”</p>

<p>“This is Farmer Joel’s land, and we’re staying
at his house,” said Russ. “Course we
have a right to fish here!”</p>

<p>“You have not!” cried the peddler. “And
you’d better get away before I make you. I’ll
punch you—that’s what I’ll do!”</p>

<p>Russ leaped to his feet and started toward
the peddler lad, who was larger than Russ.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried Mun Bun.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the peddler drew back his
fist and struck Russ, knocking him down.</p>

<span class="fs80">YELLOW AND WHITE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mun Bun felt like bursting into tears.
To see his beloved big brother, Russ, knocked
down in this fashion was enough to make any
small boy cry. It was almost like the time
when Russ was so nearly run over by the truck.</p>

<p>But suddenly it came to Mun Bun that he
must be brave. If Russ were badly hurt Mun
Bun must do something about it—just what,
of course, Mun Bun did not know. But he
felt he must not cry.</p>

<p>So he “squeezed back” the tears, as he said
later, and then he did what perhaps was not
just right, but what, I think, most children
would have done had the boy who started the
fight been a big boy, as was the peddler lad.</p>

<p>Mun Bun caught up a stone and threw it
at the peddler boy.</p>

<p>“You let my brother alone!” cried Mun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
Bun angrily. “I’ll throw another stone at you
if you don’t. And I’ll call my father! I’ll
go get my father now—and Farmer Joel and
Adam! That’s what I’ll do!”</p>

<p>Usually Mun Bun was not a very straight
shot with a stone or a baseball. Generally,
when Mun Bun threw, Russ would laugh and
say the safest place was right in front of the
little fellow. For Mun Bun seldom hit the
thing he aimed at.</p>

<p>However, this time, as luck would have it,
the stone he threw struck the peddler boy on
the shoulder. And then the peddler boy ran
away, leaving Russ lying there. I think the
peddler boy ran more because of what Mun
Bun said about Mr. Bunker being called than
because of the stone, for it was a small one
and could not have hurt him much.</p>

<p>“There! He’s gone, Russ!” cried Mun
Bun, as he ran to his brother. “You needn’t
be ’fraid any more!”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I’m not afraid!” boasted Russ, as
he arose. He had been stunned by the blow
and the fall, and really was not much hurt.
“I was going to get up and punch him,” went
on Russ. “He hit me too sudden, or he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
wouldn’t have knocked me down. I was just
getting up to hit him.”</p>

<p>“He ran away. I made him run!” cried
Mun Bun. “I hit him with a stone and he
ran away!”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” exclaimed Russ, and then
Laddie came back from down the stream
where he had gone to fish.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Laddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, that mean peddler boy was around
again,” said Russ. “He hit me and knocked
me down. He hit me before I had a chance
to fight him.”</p>

<p>Laddie dropped his pole and line.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” cried the little fellow.
“I’ll fix him!”</p>

<p>“Mun Bun fixed him,” chuckled Russ, telling
what had happened.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s the matter with that fellow,
anyhow?” asked Laddie, when he had
looked around among the bushes and made
sure the ugly peddler chap was not to be seen.
“What’s the matter with him, stealing things
and knocking folks down?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Russ, with a
shake of his head. “That’s like one of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
riddles, Laddie, only it isn’t so easy to answer.
He didn’t have any good reason for
hitting me.”</p>

<p>“We’ll tell Farmer Joel on him,” said Mun
Bun.</p>

<p>And this was done when the boys went back
to the house after each catching a few more
fish. They really did very well, and Mrs.
Bunker said they had enough for what Norah
called a “mess,” meaning enough to cook so
all would have some to eat.</p>

<p>“That boy is a rascal,” said Farmer Joel,
when he heard what had happened. “I’ll tell
the constable about him, and if he finds out
where the peddler is staying I’ll have him
arrested.”</p>

<p>“And if I find him,” threatened Adam
North, “I’ll set him out among the beehives
and let him get stung three or four times.
That will cure him of wanting to knock people
down.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of bees,” said Mr. Bunker to
Farmer Joel, “did you ever find that swarm
that got away?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” answered Farmer Joel.
“But I wish I could, for that was a valuable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
queen. I guess they’re somewhere in the
woods, but I’m afraid I’ll never get them
back.”</p>

<p>Russ had a little bruise on his chin where
the peddler boy had struck him, and Mother
Bunker bathed the sore spot with witch hazel,
which made it feel better.</p>

<p>Aside from this little happening and small
accidents that occurred from day to day, the
six little Bunkers had wonderfully good times
at Farmer Joel’s. They played all day long
out of doors when it did not rain, and when
it showered there was the big barn.</p>

<p>As the summer passed many good things to
eat ripened on the trees in the farmer’s orchard.
There were apples, plums, peaches,
and pears, and Mrs. Bunker had a hard time
to keep the children from eating so much fruit
that it would make them ill.</p>

<p>One day they were all out in the orchard
helping gather the apples. Farmer Joel,
Adam, another hired man and Mr. Bunker
were picking the apples and packing them in
boxes and baskets to be sent away. Care was
used in picking the apples not to let them
fall, for if they were bruised they soon rotted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Apples that fell to the ground were not packed
and shipped away with the best fruit. Farmer
Joel was very particular with his apples.</p>

<p>I said the six little Bunkers were helping
pick the apples, but of course the four smaller
ones could not do much more than pick up
those that fell to the ground when the tree
was shaken by the men climbing up in
it. To their great delight, Russ and Rose
were allowed to climb up some of the low
trees.</p>

<p>Mun Bun was running about in the orchard,
laughing and having a good time, when he
suddenly gave a howl, calling:</p>

<p>“Oh, that boy hit me! That peddler boy
hit me on the head with a stone! Look out
for the peddler boy!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Farmer Joel. “Is
that rascal here?”</p>

<p>Mun Bun sat down on the ground, and this
time he cried real tears.</p>

<p>“That boy hit me on the head with a stone!”
he sobbed.</p>

<p>For a time there was some excitement, the
men coming down out of the trees to look for
the peddler boy. But a moment later along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
came Ralph Watson from the next farm, and
with him was his dog Jimsie.</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of a peddler boy?”
Ralph was asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Mun Bun was hit by a stone
at all!” suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Bunker,
looking at Mun Bun’s head. “I don’t believe
that peddler boy has been here, either.”</p>

<p>“But something hit me, Mother!” insisted
Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was an apple falling from one
of the trees,” his mother said. “Look, here
is an apple leaf in your hair, Mun Bun. It
was an apple that hit you.”</p>

<p>And, surely enough, when they looked,
there on the ground beside Mun Bun was an
apple. They were more sure it was a bit of
fruit that had hit him a moment or two lately
for suddenly Jimsie, the dog, let out a howl,
and they all saw an apple fall and hit the dog
on the head.</p>

<p>This made Mun Bun laugh, and he said:</p>

<p>“Jimsie got hit just like me, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“And he howled pretty nearly as loudly,”
chuckled Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I’d better take the smaller children
in from the orchard,” said Mrs. Bunker,
after a while. “A lot of apples are falling,
and some are so large and hard that little
heads might be hurt.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s as well,” agreed Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“You may gather the eggs, if you wish,”
said Farmer Joel. “It’s about time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” cried Violet.</p>

<p>“An’ I want a basket all by myself!” insisted
Margy.</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Mun Bun, forgetting all
about being hit by a falling apple.</p>

<p>So off to the barn went Mrs. Bunker, with
Margy and Mun Bun, Laddie and Violet,
while Russ, Rose, and Ralph remained in the
orchard to help pick the apples.</p>

<p>Most of the hens laid in nests in the big
hen-house built for them, but there were some
of the chickens that “stole their nests,” as
Farmer Joel said, going in the barn, or even
under it.</p>

<p>The children had been around long enough
now to know where most of these hidden nests
were, and they scattered and began looking
for the eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bunker had the basket with the most
of the eggs in, for she did not dare trust them
to the children. She was coming out of the
hen-house with Laddie and Violet when Mun
Bun, who had gone into the barn with Margy,
came running up to his mother.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried the little fellow. “You
ought to see her!”</p>

<p>“See whom?” asked Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Margy!” gasped Mun Bun. “She’s all
yellow and white!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="fs80">A MAD BULL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Violet almost dropped her basket of eggs,
she was so excited.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” she cried. “Maybe Margy’s
getting the chicken pox or something like that.
All yellow and white! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t chicken pox,” said Mrs. Bunker,
trying not to laugh. “Though I think it has
something to do with chickens—and eggs.
You say Margy is all yellow and white, Mun
Bun?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, but the yellow shows most. It’s all
over her face and her dress——”</p>

<p>“The poor thing!” murmured Violet.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and help her,” offered Laddie, not
stopping to make a riddle this time, though
he said later that he had one about a chicken
and an egg if he could only think of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“She’s right around here—under the barn,”
went on Mun Bun, leading the way from the
hen-house.</p>

<p>“Under the barn?” asked Mrs. Bunker.
“Is she caught fast there?”</p>

<p>“No, Mother,” replied Mun Bun. “She’s
just all whites and yellows. She crawled
under the barn to get some eggs, and when
she came out with ’em in her dress, why—now—she—she
slipped and she fell down and—and—the
eggs all busted and——”</p>

<p>“There she is now!” interrupted Violet, as
they came within sight of the unfortunate
Margy. Well might Violet murmur: “Poor
dear!”</p>

<p>Margy seemed covered with the whites and
yellows of broken eggs from her head to her
feet. And, as Mun Bun said, the “yellow
showed the most.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor child!” exclaimed Mrs.
Bunker, trying not to laugh. “Come to the
house and I’ll wash you clean. Poor Margy!
Never mind, dear!” for Margy was crying.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t—mean—to break the—the—eggs!”
she sobbed. “You s’pose Farmer Joel—you
s’pose he’ll be very mad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Of course not!” Mrs. Bunker hastened to
say. “He doesn’t mind a few eggs. The
hens will lay more.”</p>

<p>“If she’d had on a rubber apron it would
have been all right,” said Laddie, as they
went on toward the house.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” Violet, as usual, asked
a question.</p>

<p>“Why, if Margy had had on a rubber
apron the whites and yellows of the eggs
wouldn’t ‘a’ soaked out and she could carry
’em to the kitchen and Norah could make a
cake. She says broken eggs are just as good
for cakes as other eggs.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Violet. “’Cause you have to
break eggs, anyhow, to get them into a cake.
But even if Margy had these in a rubber
apron, there’d be a lot of shells.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Laddie. “I guess even
a rubber apron wouldn’t be much good. The
best way is not to break eggs. Now I’m going
to make a riddle about them.” And he
did. He himself said afterward it wasn’t a
very good riddle. Laddie would ask:</p>

<p>“How can you get an egg out of the shell
without breaking it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>And after every one had given up he would
answer:</p>

<p>“You can’t.”</p>

<p>Sometimes Laddie made up better riddles
than that.</p>

<p>Margy was washed and a clean dress was
put on her, and by this time the men and Russ
and Rose came in from the apple orchard and
it was almost time for supper.</p>

<p>Norah had cooked a good meal, and it was
well that she had, for every one had a hearty
appetite. Working in the apple orchard and
gathering eggs made them all hungry.</p>

<p>It was several days after this that, when
Mrs. Bunker was taking the four smaller children
for a walk through the fields, a distant
rumbling sound was heard.</p>

<p>“Is that thunder?” asked Violet, looking
toward the sky.</p>

<p>“I think not,” her mother answered. “If it
is, the storm is a distant one and will not break
until we get home.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t thunder,” announced Laddie, after
the rumbling sound was heard again.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Mun Bun wanted to know.</p>

<p>“It’s Farmer Joel’s bull,” said Laddie. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
can see him down in that field,” and he
pointed to a distant pasture in which, all
alone, was the big bull, roaming around, pawing
the ground, shaking his head, and now and
then uttering the low, rumbling bellow, which
sounded like distant thunder.</p>

<p>“Oh, so it is the bull,” remarked Mrs.
Bunker, when, from a distant hill, they had
watched the powerful animal running about.</p>

<p>“I hope the fence is good and strong so he
can’t get loose,” said Violet.</p>

<p>“I guess Farmer Joel wouldn’t turn the bull
into a field unless the fence was good and
strong,” replied Mrs. Bunker.</p>

<p>“Mother, what would we do if the bull got
loose and chased us?” Margy asked.</p>

<p>“The best thing to do, I suppose,” said
Mother Bunker, “would be to run and get on
the other side of a strong fence, if it could be
done. Or climb a tree. Bulls can’t go up
trees.”</p>

<p>“But after you got up into the tree he might
hit the tree with his head and knock you out
and hook you, mightn’t he?” asked Violet.</p>

<p>“Well, he might,” replied her mother.
“Perhaps it would be best not to go anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
near the bull. But if he should come after
you—run away somewhere or get behind a
fence or something.”</p>

<p>“He’s terrible strong, isn’t he?” observed
Mun Bun, as he watched the bull hitting his
head against the fence as if trying to knock
it over.</p>

<p>“He is, indeed. Bulls are very strong,”
said his mother. “I should think Farmer
Joel would be afraid this one would knock
the fence down. But perhaps it is all right.”</p>

<p>However, the fence was not all right, or
else the bull was stronger than was supposed,
for a few days later something very alarming
took place.</p>

<p>Russ and Rose had been left in charge of
the four smaller Bunkers while their father
and mother went visiting a distant farmer
whom Mr. Bunker had known some years
before.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down and look at the water
wheel,” suggested Russ, for Laddie, Violet,
Mun Bun and Margy never seemed to tire
of this.</p>

<p>“Will that old peddler boy come and hit
you again?” Mun Bun wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“No, I guess he’s gone away,” answered
Russ.</p>

<p>Down to the brook they went, a merry,
happy group of children. They threw stones
into the water, set little bits of wood afloat,
pretending they were boats, and had a good
time watching the splashing water wheel.</p>

<p>Suddenly Laddie, who had wandered off a
little way to gather some brown cattails growing
in a swampy place, came running back,
fear showing on his face.</p>

<p>“He—he’s coming!” gasped Laddie.</p>

<p>“Who? That peddler boy?” demanded
Russ, clenching his fists.</p>

<p>“No! The mad bull! He’s coming!
Look out!” shouted Laddie.</p>

<span class="fs80">AFTER WILD FLOWERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment or two Russ did not know
whether or not Laddie was joking. The little
fellow often played tricks, and this might
be one of these times. But when Russ looked
at Laddie’s face the older Bunker boy felt
sure there must be something wrong.</p>

<p>Still, before getting excited about it, and,
perhaps, unnecessarily frightening Rose,
Margy, Mun Bun and Violet, it might be well
to make sure. So Russ asked:</p>

<p>“Which way is he coming, Laddie?”</p>

<p>“Right across the lots,” was the answer. “I
saw him when I was after cattails. He’s coming
right this way!”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better hide behind a fence,”
advised Violet. “The other day, when we
saw the old mad bull pawing in his field and
making a noise like thunder, mother said we
should hide behind a fence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“There isn’t any fence here to hide behind,”
said Mun Bun, who was beginning to
understand what it was all about.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the bull make a noise like
thunder?” asked Violet. You might be sure
she would put in a question or two, no matter
what was happening.</p>

<p>Before Laddie could answer, and while
Russ and Rose were thinking what was best
to do to get their younger brothers and sisters
out of the way of the powerful beast, there
came from the near-by meadow a rumbling
sound.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried Laddie. “I mean
here he comes, and he’s bellowing like thunder!”</p>

<p>Certainly it was a fearsome sound.</p>

<p>“I want my mamma!” wailed Margy.</p>

<p>“So do I!” joined in Mun Bun.</p>

<p>“We’ll take care of you!” quickly said Rose,
putting her arms around the two younger children.
“Oh, Russ!” she whispered, “what are
we going to do?”</p>

<p>“We ought to have something red to shake
at the bull!” cried Violet. “Red makes bulls
go away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“It does not!” declared Laddie. “It’s just
different. Red makes ’em run at you! Has
anybody got any red on?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>He looked quickly at the others. To his
relief no red was to be seen, and Laddie was
glad. As yet the bull was not in sight, for
the children were on one side of the brook
and on either bank was a fringe of bushes and
cattails, and these hid the oncoming animal.
But if he was not seen he was heard, and once
more his loud bellow sounded.</p>

<p>“Come on! Run!” screamed Violet.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d better get away from here,”
agreed Russ, looking about for a safe place.</p>

<p>Laddie, who had picked up a stone, perhaps
intending to throw it and, maybe, hit the bull
on the nose, dropped the rock. Rose had
started on ahead with Mun Bun and Margy,
and Russ now took the hands of Violet and
Laddie, for he felt he could help them run
faster this way. Then Rose, who was a little
distance ahead, cried out:</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a good place to hide!”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“In the old hen-house! We can go in there
and lock ourselves in. Come on!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>She pointed to an old and rather ramshackle
sort of building that had been used
as a hen-house by Farmer Joel before he built
a better one nearer the barn. This old hen-house
was down near the bank of the brook,
and the children had often played in it. Now
it seemed just the refuge they needed.</p>

<p>“The old bull can knock that house
down!” said Laddie. “It’s almost falling,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“It’s better than nothing,” Russ declared.
“And there isn’t any fence to hide behind.
Come on to the hen-house, everybody!”</p>

<p>Behind them came the bellowing bull.
They could hear him “roaring,” as Mun Bun
called it, and, as he looked back over his
shoulder, Russ saw the powerful animal
splashing his way across the brook.</p>

<p>“He’s surely coming after us!” the boy
thought. He had hoped that perhaps the
bull might wander off somewhere else.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” screamed Margy. “He’ll hook
us!”</p>

<p>I do not really believe the bull at first had
any notion of running after the children. He
had merely gotten out of his pasture and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
wandering about when Laddie saw him. He
came to the brook to get a drink.</p>

<p>Then, after splashing into the water and
quenching his thirst, he saw the six little
Bunkers and actually ran toward them. But
they had a good start and hastened toward the
hen-house.</p>

<p>With a bellow the bull took after them, his
tail out stiff in the air, his head down and his
hoofs making the dirt fly. There were, perhaps,
more reasons than one why the bull
chased the children. He might have thought
they had salt to give him, for often Farmer
Joel and his men gave this dainty to the bull
and the cows in the fields. Or the bull may
have been just playful. Or perhaps his temper
was just ugly. It is hard to tell sometimes
the difference between playfulness and
temper. Bulls are strong and like to show
off their strength, sometimes butting their
heads against a fence just for fun, it seems.</p>

<p>At any rate on came this bull after the children,
and Russ and Rose hastened with their
younger brothers and sisters toward the open
door of the hen-house.</p>

<p>They reached it some little distance ahead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
of the charging animal. In they ran. Russ
closed the door and placed against it a strong
stick he found on the floor. The hen-house
was deserted except for one chicken that had
strayed in to lay an egg, and she flew off the
nest, cackling in surprise, as the children
entered.</p>

<p>Mun Bun and Margy laughed at this, and
Rose was glad, for she did not want them to
be too frightened. She and Russ expected
every moment to hear the bull dash against
the hen-house door. The boy was afraid, if
this happened, that the shaky door would be
broken so the bull could get in.</p>

<p>But, to his surprise, a moment later Laddie
cried:</p>

<p>“Look! He ran right past here!”</p>

<p>And that is just what happened. The bull,
charging head down, had carried himself well
past the hen-house, but could be seen to one
side rushing around.</p>

<p>That is one difference between a bull and
a cow. A bull charges with his head down
and cannot well see where he is going, so that
if one is very active he can leap out of the
way. But a cow rushes at you with head up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and “takes better aim,” as Laddie expressed it.</p>

<p>So this is how it happened that the bull
rushed past the hen-house without doing any
damage. Rose breathed a sigh of relief, and
she said:</p>

<p>“Now don’t make any noise and maybe he
won’t know we’re here. Keep still!”</p>

<p>And you may be sure the four small little
Bunkers did—very still.</p>

<p>Through the window the children watched
the bull. He stopped running and looked
about. He bellowed, he pawed the earth, and
he seemed puzzled. Perhaps he was wondering
where those children went to, and how
thankful they all were that they were in the
hen-house!</p>

<p>“But if he bumps into it he’ll knock it
over,” whispered Laddie.</p>

<p>However, the bull did nothing of the sort.
Perhaps he thought the hen-house was a barn,
and may have imagined if he “bumped into
it” he would have to stay in, and he would
rather be out in the fields. So he wandered
about the hen-house, muttering and bellowing,
as if daring any one to do anything to him.</p>

<p>Of course the children dared not come out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
while the bull was there, and they did not
know what to do. But they were glad of one
thing, and this was that the animal did not
try to come in after them.</p>

<p>“But maybe he will come,” suggested Laddie,
in a whisper, when Rose and Russ talked
about how lucky it was that the bull hadn’t
tried to butt down the old hen-house.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe he’ll come in now,”
said Russ.</p>

<p>“Shall we have to stay here all night?” Violet
wanted to know, when they had been in
the hen-house nearly ten minutes and the bull
had shown no likelihood of going away soon.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it here. I want to go out and
play!” said Mun Bun, but he was careful not
to speak above a whisper, for he could see
the bull through the dirty windows of the
place.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was well that the windows were
dirty, for the bull could not look in through
them and see the children.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe we’ll have to stay here
all night,” said Russ, though he had no idea
how they would get away nor how soon.</p>

<p>However, help was on the way. Adam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
North, walking down toward the brook, heard
the low, muttering bellows of the bull, and
then saw him moving about the old hen-house.</p>

<p>“Hello, my fine fellow, how did you get
out of your pasture?” asked Adam, speaking
to the bull as one might to a dog. “You’ve
been up to some mischief, I’m sure. I wonder——Bless
my stars! The children!”
cried Adam North. “Have you been chasing
the six little Bunkers?”</p>

<p>Adam looked about but could see no sign
of the boys and girls, so he felt pretty sure
they were safe, wherever they were. But he
knew the bull must be shut up in his pasture
or he might do some damage. Calling another
hired man, and each of them taking a
sharp pitchfork, of which the bull was much
afraid, they drove him away from the hen-house,
back across the brook, and into his pasture,
where the broken fence was made secure.</p>

<p>Then, when Adam and his helper came
back after having driven away the bull, out
of the hen-house rushed the six little Bunkers.
They had watched Adam and the other man
drive away the animal, but had not dared
come out until everything was all right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Were you in there all the while?” asked
Adam North.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Russ. “We ran in there
when the bull chased us.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was the best thing you could have
done. My! I’m glad nothing happened to
you. The old bull may have intended just to
play with you, but even to be tossed in fun
on a bull’s horns is no joke.”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” agreed Russ.</p>

<p>So that happening ended safely.</p>

<p>“People talk about the quiet life on a
farm!” Mrs. Bunker said to her husband
when she came home that evening and heard
what had taken place. “This far our vacation
has been anything but quiet.”</p>

<p>“The children seem to enjoy it, though,”
said Mr. Bunker. “Even being chased by a
bull appears to agree with them. I never
saw them with such appetites,” for this talk
took place at the supper table.</p>

<p>“Oh, they can always eat,” laughed Mrs.
Bunker. “I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>Farmer Joel made sure the next day that
the bull’s fence was made so strong that he
could not again get out, and all the hired men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
were told to be very careful if they opened
the gate to make positive that it was fastened.</p>

<p>“What are you children going to do to-day?”
asked Farmer Joel at the breakfast
table the next morning. “Are you going to
chase any more bulls?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, we didn’t chase <em>him</em>! He
chased <em>us</em>!” exclaimed Violet, looking at her
mother in surprise.</p>

<p>“Farmer Joel is only joking, my dear,” said
her mother, and then Violet saw the twinkle
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“If you have nothing special to do,” went
on Mr. Todd, “you might gather some wild
flowers. There’s going to be a church sociable,
and my sister generally gathers flowers
to decorate. But as she isn’t here now——”</p>

<p>“We’ll get the flowers for you,” quickly offered
Mrs. Bunker. “Come, children, we’ll
go to the woods and get flowers for the
church.”</p>

<p>They were soon on their way to a place
where, Farmer Joel said, many kinds of wild
flowers grew. All six of the little Bunkers
went with their mother.</p>

<p>They strolled through the field, and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
distant pasture saw the old bull that had
chased them. But he seemed good-natured
now, for he was lying under a tree asleep.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have a riddle!” suddenly cried Laddie.
“When is a bad bull a good bull?”</p>

<p>“After he gets whipped, maybe,” suggested
Russ.</p>

<p>“After they give him salt,” said Rose, when
Laddie had said Russ was wrong.</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t it,” the riddle-giver replied.
“A bad bull is a good bull when he’s asleep.”</p>

<p>“He’s like some children I know,” said Mrs.
Bunker, with a smile.</p>

<p>Then they reached the place where the wild
flowers grew and began to pick them. There
were many and beautiful blossoms. Rose was
reaching over to gather a red bloom when suddenly
she heard a queer sound near her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Russ!” she cried. “It’s a rattlesnake!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="fs80">A MEAN BOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Rose dropped her bunch of wild flowers
and ran toward her brother. As for Russ,
he hardly knew what to do. He, also, had
heard the buzzing, rattling sound and he had
heard stories of how poisonous rattlesnakes
are.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him get me! Don’t let the snake
bite me!” Rose cried.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any snake,” Russ answered,
looking down in the grass. His mother and
the other children were some distance off.</p>

<p>“I don’t see it, but I heard it,” Rose exclaimed,
very much excited.</p>

<p>Then Russ heard again the queer sound and
at once it came to his mind what it was. He
had often heard it before, back in Pineville
on hot, summer days—just such a day as this
was—toward the end of the season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“That isn’t a rattlesnake, Rose,” said Russ.
“Don’t be a baby!”</p>

<p>“What was it then?” she asked. “It sounded
just like a rattlesnake. I mean like I think
one would sound, for I never saw any.”</p>

<p>“It was a locust,” answered Russ. “I guess
it’s on this tree,” and he pointed to one near
which they had been gathering flowers. “Yes,
it’s on this tree, I see it!” he added, as the
sound came again. “Come and watch how
funny it does it, Rose. It jiggles itself all
over.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it isn’t a snake?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Of course I am!” said Russ. “Why, I’m
looking right now at the locust. It’s low
down. I never saw one so low. Most always
when they sing out like that they’re high
in the trees. Come quick, before it flies
away.”</p>

<p>Rose came over to Russ’s side. She looked
to where he pointed and saw a curious winged
insect that, just as Rose arrived, began to give
forth its queer song. And, as Russ said, the
locust seemed to “jiggle” all over. Its wings
and legs trembled with the force of the noise
it made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>“Will it bite?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Russ answered. “I’m not
going to put my finger near enough to find
out. I heard Farmer Joel say the locusts ate
up most of his garden one year, so I guess they
must bite some things. Anyhow, it isn’t a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” answered Rose, with a
breath of relief, as she picked up her scattered
wild flowers.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter over there?” called
Mrs. Bunker, as she saw Rose and Russ moving
about the tree.</p>

<p>“Rose thought she heard a rattlesnake, but
it wasn’t,” Russ laughed.</p>

<p>“What was it?” Violet wanted to know.</p>

<p>“A locust,” Russ replied, and then all the
children wanted to see the insect, watching it
vibrate itself on a tree and make that queer
sound.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he would do if I tickled
him?” said Laddie. And when he tried it,
gently pushing the locust with a small twig,
the insect quickly flew away.</p>

<p>“I guess there are no rattlesnakes around
here,” said Mrs. Bunker, when the excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
had died away. “Now go on with your
flower-gathering, children. We must get
some fine bouquets for Farmer Joel.”</p>

<p>The wild flowers made a grand display in
the Sunday-school room of the church, which
was decorated with them for the annual festival.
The six little Bunkers attended for a
short time and had lots of fun.</p>

<p>Mun Bun spilled his dish of ice cream in
the lap of a lady next to whom he was sitting,
and Margy tipped over her glass of lemonade,
letting it run down the neck of her dress.
This so excited her that she cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m getting drowned! I’m getting
drowned!” But of course she wasn’t. It
made some excitement, though.</p>

<p>The lady in whose lap Mun Bun spilled
the ice cream was very kind about it. She
said it was a last year’s dress, anyhow, and
now she would have a good reason for getting
a new one.</p>

<p>When the six little Bunkers went home from
the church festival Laddie tried to make up a
riddle about Margy’s getting wet with the
lemonade.</p>

<p>“I want to make a riddle about her but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
can’t think just how to do it,” said the little
fellow to Russ.</p>

<p>“Why not ask, When is Margy like a goldfish?”
Russ suggested.</p>

<p>“What would the answer be?” inquired
Laddie.</p>

<p>“Oh, you could say when she tried to swim
in lemonade,” replied Russ.</p>

<p>“I guess I will,” decided Laddie, and he
had that for a new riddle, though it was not
as clever as some he had thought up all by
himself.</p>

<p>There were many happy days spent in the
woods and fields about Farmer Joel’s by the
six little Bunkers. Every morning when the
children arose there was the prospect of happy
times ahead of them. And nearly always
these happy expectations came true. Even
when it rained, as I have said, the children
could play in the big barn on the pile of
fragrant hay they had helped put in.</p>

<p>One fine day when Farmer Joel drove into
town with Mr. and Mrs. Bunker, who wanted
to do some shopping, the six little Bunkers
were left in charge of Norah and Adam
North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>Russ, Rose and the others played about the
house and yard for a while, Russ putting some
“improvements” as he called them, on his
water wheel, and Rose helping Norah bake
a cake.</p>

<p>Then Laddie and Violet, who had been
playing with Mun Bun and Margy in the
swing under the tree, came to the house asking:</p>

<p>“Can’t we go to the woods and have a
picnic?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we couldn’t have a picnic without
mother,” objected Rose.</p>

<p>“Just a little one,” begged Violet. “Couldn’t
you give us a few cookies, or something like
that, Norah? We could go off to the woods,
near the place where we picked the wild flowers,
and eat there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you may do that,” Norah agreed, for
she liked the children to have fun. “You had
better go with them, though, Rose and Russ,”
said the faithful cook.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’ll go,” promised Rose.</p>

<p>A little later, with small boxes and baskets
of a simple lunch, the six little Bunkers set
off for the woods once more. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
laughing, singing, and shouting, having a fine
time, and they had no idea that there would
be trouble.</p>

<p>Russ found a place where a little spring
bubbled up, and it was decided they would
eat their lunch there when the time came, as,
from past experience, Russ knew the children
would be thirsty as soon as they had eaten.
And nothing so spoils a picnic in the woods
as not being able to get a drink of water when
you need it.</p>

<p>Rose and Russ put the lunch away on top
of a stump and then the smaller children began
playing about under the trees. Rose had
brought along a partly finished dress for one
of her dolls, and she was sewing on this, while
Russ cut a stick and began to make a whistle.</p>

<p>“Though I’m not sure I can make it,” he
said, puckering up his own lips to send forth
a shrill tune.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Laddie.</p>

<p>“Well, the bark doesn’t peel off so well now
as it does in the spring,” Russ answered.
“But maybe if I pound it long enough I can
slip it off.”</p>

<p>An hour or more passed pleasantly, the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
busy at their different means of having
fun, and then Mun Bun came toward Rose,
saying:</p>

<p>“I’m hungry now. I want to eat.”</p>

<p>“So do I!” added Margy, who generally
wanted to do whatever she heard Mun Bun
say he wanted to do.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we can have lunch,” decided
Rose. “Ho, Russ!” she called.</p>

<p>A loud whistle answered her, for Russ had
succeeded in stripping the bark from a tree
branch and had whittled out a whistle that
was louder than the one formed by his lips.</p>

<p>“Come, we’re going to eat!” called Rose,
and soon all six little Bunkers were walking
toward the stump where the lunch had been
left.</p>

<p>But when they reached it—the lunch was
gone!</p>

<p>“Who took it?” demanded Rose.</p>

<p>“I didn’t! You needn’t look at me!” declared
Laddie quickly. He sometimes did
play jokes like this—if you call them jokes.</p>

<p>“Are you sure we left it on this stump?”
asked Russ.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m sure,” said Rose. “Look,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
you can see some of the crumbs. Oh, Russ,
some one has eaten the lunch!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a bear!” suggested Violet,
with a little shiver of mixed delight and fear.</p>

<p>“There are no bears here,” Russ replied impatiently.</p>

<p>“Then maybe it was a squirrel,” suggested
Laddie.</p>

<p>“A squirrel couldn’t carry away the boxes,
baskets, and everything!” declared Rose.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from behind the bushes, came a
chuckle in a boy’s voice. At first Russ thought
perhaps Ralph Watson and his dog Jimsie had
come along, and that Ralph had hidden the
lunch for fun. But a moment later the ugly
face of the peddler boy looked out from the
bushes.</p>

<p>“I took your lunch!” he said. “I ate it!
I ate it all up!”</p>

<span class="fs80">STUNG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment or two the six little Bunkers
could hardly believe this dreadful news. In
fact the two youngest did not quite understand
what the peddler boy said. Then Rose exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, you couldn’t! You couldn’t eat all
our lunch!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” chuckled the mean peddler
boy. “Yes, I did! I was terribly hungry,
and I ate it all! You took your strawberry
shortcake away from me, but you can’t take
this lunch away, because I ate it all up! Ha!
Ha!”</p>

<p>“You horrid boy!” cried Rose. She said
afterward she just couldn’t help calling him
that name, even though it was not very polite.
But, then, he wasn’t polite himself, that peddler
boy wasn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“You—you——” began Laddie, spluttering
somewhat, which he often did when he was
excited. “Did you take my apples?” For
Laddie had put up in the lunch a special little
basket of apples.</p>

<p>“I have the apples in my pocket!” boasted
the shoe-lace boy. “I ate one of ’em, and I’ll
eat the others when I get home. But I ate
all the rest of your lunch. I haven’t any of
that in my pockets.”</p>

<p>“Look here, you—you rascal!” cried Russ.
He didn’t know what the peddler’s name was,
but “rascal,” seemed the right thing to call
him. “I’m going to tell my father and
Farmer Joel on you, and they’ll have you arrested!”
threatened Russ.</p>

<p>“Pooh! I’m not afraid!” boasted the peddler,
though he had run once before when told
that this would happen to him.</p>

<p>Russ did not know what to do. The shoe-lace
boy was larger and stronger. Once Russ
had been knocked down by the lad, and Russ
did not want this to happen again.</p>

<p>Still Russ was no coward. He never would
have gone after Violet’s doll that day when
the truck was about to run over it if he were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
a coward. So Russ made up his mind he
must do something.</p>

<p>He couldn’t get the lunch back—he knew
that—but he might punish the lad who had
taken it. So Russ doubled up his fists, and
Laddie, seeing him, did the same, for Laddie
had an idea.</p>

<p>“If we both go at him at once we can fight
him, Russ!” whispered Laddie. “You go at
him on one side and I’ll go at him on the
other.”</p>

<p>Of course this was the proper way for two
small boys to fight one large one. But Russ
did not like to fight—especially when Rose
and the other children were there.</p>

<p>“You’re a mean coward, that’s what you
are!” cried Russ. “You sneaked up and took
our lunch when we weren’t there. You
wouldn’t dare take it when we were around.”</p>

<p>And this was true. The peddler boy was
a coward, and he had watched his chance to
sneak up to the lunch when the six little Bunkers
were some distance from it.</p>

<p>“Pooh! I don’t care! I got your lunch,
anyhow, and it tasted good and you can’t get
it back!” boasted the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Mun Bun, who didn’t
quite understand what it was all about. “I’m
hungry!”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” wailed Margy.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Rose, “but the mean boy
ate up all the lunch.”</p>

<p>At last Laddie seemed unable to stand it
any longer. He felt that he must do something.</p>

<p>“Come on, Russ!” he cried. “Let’s fight
him!” And Laddie, all alone, rushed toward
the boy, who was standing on the edge of the
woods.</p>

<p>Russ knew it would not be wise to let Laddie
get near the bigger boy. Laddie might
be knocked down as Russ was, so Russ started
after Laddie. This looked to the peddler as
though he were going to be attacked. And
though he boasted of not being afraid, he was.
He felt that if Russ and Laddie, to say nothing
of Violet and Rose, all went at him together,
big and strong as he was, he would be
knocked down and beaten.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho! You can’t catch me!” he cried,
turning to run. “I ate all your lunch! Ho!
Ho! I ate all your lunch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>Away he ran, toward the woods.</p>

<p>“Coward! You’re a coward!” shrieked
Violet tauntingly.</p>

<p>“Come on! Let’s run after him!” begged
Laddie.</p>

<p>Russ looked toward the fleeing boy.</p>

<p>“No, Laddie,” he said, “it wouldn’t be any
good chasing after him. He’d get away.
But he’s a coward just the same.”</p>

<p>“He’s horrid mean—that’s what I say!” declared
Rose. “To take our nice picnic lunch!
Now we’ll have to go home.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell Farmer Joel about him,”
announced Russ.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll have him arrested,” suggested
Violet.</p>

<p>Suddenly Laddie pointed to the boy and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Look how funny he’s acting!”</p>

<p>“What makes him do that?” asked Vi.</p>

<p>“Oh, listen to him yell!” ejaculated Russ.</p>

<p>Indeed, the peddler lad was acting
strangely. He was in the woods now and he
was jumping up and down, waving his arms
about, slapping his hands on his head and
legs, and at the same time crying aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“What’s he saying?” asked Rose.</p>

<p>“Hark!” advised Russ.</p>

<p>They all listened, and from the jumping boy
came the words:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m stung! I’m stung! Take ’em
away, somebody! Take ’em away! I’m
stung!”</p>

<p>Then Rose cried:</p>

<p>“Bees! Bees! A lot of bees are after
him!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there are some buzzing around
here!” said Russ quickly. “He must have
run into a hornet’s nest or something, and
some of ’em are flying around here. I heard
’em buzz!”</p>

<p>“So did I!” added Violet.</p>

<p>“But they aren’t hornets,” said Laddie.
“Look! There’s one,” and he pointed to a
yellow-banded insect lazily flying in the air
above them. “That’s a honey bee, like those
Farmer Joel has.”</p>

<p>“And look at the lot of ’em around that
boy!” cried Rose. “Oh, what a lot of bees!”</p>

<p>She pointed to the woods where the rascally
lad was still leaping about, slapping himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
with his hands, and now and then lying down
in the dried leaves to roll about.</p>

<p>“Come on! We’d better run!” advised
Russ. “These are honey bees all right, but
they sting as badly as hornets. A swarm must
have gotten away from Farmer Joel’s and
this boy ran right into ’em. Come on, we’ll
go before they get after us.”</p>

<p>As yet only one or two bees had flown toward
the six little Bunkers, but they started
away, nevertheless, for there was no fun remaining
at a picnic if they had no lunch to
eat.</p>

<p>“Oh, look! There he goes, running!”
cried Laddie, pointing toward the peddler
boy who was darting away into the woods as
fast as he could go, followed by the cloud of
bees.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<span class="fs80">THE HONEY TREE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The six little Bunkers paused a moment
before leaving the picnic grounds, where so
sad a happening as losing their lunch had
occurred, and looked toward the peddler boy.
He was certainly running as hard as he could
to get away from the stinging insects.</p>

<p>“It serves him right for taking our lunch!”
declared Rose, though perhaps she shouldn’t
have said it.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose the bees knew he took our
things? And did they sting him because they
like us and because Farmer Joel has bees like
these bees?” asked Violet, looking at a honey
insect perched on a flower. Violet seemed to
think it best to ask as many questions at once
as possible.</p>

<p>But no one took the trouble to answer them.
Russ and Rose were anxious to get the smaller
children out of the way of the bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>“Come, children! We’ve got to hurry, just
as Russ says,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Is it goin’ to rain?” asked Mun Bun. Generally
when there was a shower coming up he
knew the need of haste.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t going to rain,” said Russ. “If
it did it would send the bees into shelter and
they wouldn’t take after that boy.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they stung him much?”
asked Rose.</p>

<p>“From the way he yelled I should say they
stung him pretty hard,” Russ answered. “I’m
glad they didn’t come our way.”</p>

<p>By this time they were some distance from
their picnic ground, and no bees were buzzing
around them.</p>

<p>“Do you think they were Farmer Joel’s
bees?” asked Rose of Russ, as they walked on
toward the house.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure of it,” was his reply. “No
one else around here keeps honey bees.”</p>

<p>“Are there any other kinds of bees except
honey bees?” Vi wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Rose. “Ask mother
about them—or daddy.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, children, didn’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
have fun at your picnic?” Norah wanted to
know, when the six little Bunkers came
straggling back, some hours before she expected
them. Farmer Joel and Mr. and Mrs.
Bunker were still in town.</p>

<p>“Yes, we had some fun,” answered Rose.
“But we had to come back to get more lunch,”
for she had decided, as it was not yet late,
they could go back to the woods.</p>

<p>“You want more lunch!” cried the good-natured
cook. “Bless and save us, my dears!
But if you ate all that, and want more—oh,
I wouldn’t dare give it to you! Your mother
wouldn’t like it. You’d get sick.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t eat it!” cried Laddie.</p>

<p>“You didn’t? Who did?”</p>

<p>“The peddler boy!”</p>

<p>And then the story was told—about the bees
and everything. Norah laughed when she
heard how the bad boy had been sent howling
into the woods by the stings of the honey insects,
and she quickly put up another lunch
for the children.</p>

<p>“But if you go back to the same place to
eat it,” she said, “that same peddler boy may
take it again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“No, he won’t!” cried Russ. “If he does—I’ll
take a big club along this time.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll hide the lunch where he can’t
find it,” added Laddie.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll be so hungry we’ll eat it as
soon as we get to the woods and then there
won’t be anything left for him to take,” observed
Violet. And this was voted the best
idea of all.</p>

<p>“But maybe the bees might sting you,” said
Norah. “Perhaps you had better stay around
here and eat.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” answered Russ. “We’ll
go just a little way into the woods—not as
far as before, and then the bees won’t come.
But did any swarm get away from here,
Norah? It was a swarm of bees we saw in
the woods chasing that peddler boy.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t hear of any swarm getting
away from here,” said Norah. “But then I
don’t know much about bees. Better ask
Adam.”</p>

<p>Before starting off on their second picnic
Russ found the hired man and inquired about
the swarm of bees.</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t come from here,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
Adam. “I’ve been around the orchard all
day and I’ve seen no bees starting out to take
an excursion with the queen. They must be
from somewhere else, but I don’t know of any
one who has bees around here except Farmer
Joel.”</p>

<p>The children gave little more thought to
the bees, because they were hungry and
wanted to have fun off in the woods eating
the second lunch that Norah had put up for
them.</p>

<p>This time no bad boy took the good things,
and the six little Bunkers had the cakes and
sandwiches for themselves. It was while they
were walking along the road on their way
home later in the afternoon that the carriage
of Dr. Snow passed them.</p>

<p>The six little Bunkers had met Dr. Snow
a few weeks before, when one of Farmer
Joel’s hired men had cut his foot with an axe.
The doctor had called at the farmhouse several
times and now knew every one from Mun
Bun to Russ. Seeing the doctor driving past
in a hurry and knowing that by this time Mr.
and Mrs. Bunker must be at home, Russ began
to wonder if an accident had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“Is any one sick at Farmer Joel’s?” called
Russ, as the doctor’s carriage drove past.</p>

<p>“No, my little man. No, I’m glad to say,”
answered Dr. Snow, pulling his horses to a
stop. “I’m not going to stop at Farmer Joel’s.
I’m on my way to see a peddler boy who lives
on the other side of the valley. They telephoned
me to come to see him. He has been
badly stung by bees.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that must be our boy!” cried Rose.</p>

<p>“Your boy?” exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>“I mean the one who took our lunch,” and
Rose related the story.</p>

<p>“Yes, very likely it’s the same boy,” said the
physician, with a smile. “Well, I’ll do the
best I can for him. But I think this will be
a lesson to him.”</p>

<p>The doctor drove on and the six little Bunkers
hurried to the house and soon were telling
their father and mother all that had happened
during the day.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Farmer Joel, when
he heard the tale. “Some bees came out of
the woods and stung the boy, you say?”</p>

<p>“You should have heard him yell!” remarked
Russ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like to see any one hurt,”
went on Farmer Joel. “But this story of bees
in the woods is a strange one. No swarms
have left my hives lately and—say, wait—I
have an idea!” he suddenly cried.</p>

<p>“Did you see a hollow tree anywhere near
the place the bees swarmed out on the boy
and stung him?” asked the farmer of Russ.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. “We weren’t close
enough to see a hollow tree. But we could
see the bees.”</p>

<p>“And we could see the boy dance,” added
Laddie.</p>

<p>“Hum!” mused Farmer Joel. “It’s just
possible now,” he proceeded, “that these bees
are the same swarm that went away with my
fifty-dollar queen soon after you six little Bunkers
arrived. In fact, I’m pretty sure they’re
my bees, but I’m going to find out for certain.
That’s what I’m going to do!”</p>

<p>“How can you?” asked Mr. Bunker.</p>

<p>“I’ll get your children to show me as nearly
as they can the place the bees stung this peddler
boy, and I’ll look around there for my
missing swarm and the queen. They must
have made a home for themselves in some hollow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
tree, those bees must, and when the boy
wandered too near it they swarmed out and
stung him, for they thought he was after the
honey they had stored there.”</p>

<p>“But if the runaway bees rushed out and
stung the boy, won’t they come out and sting
you if you try to get them back?” asked Mrs.
Bunker.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait until cold weather, until the bees
are asleep in the tree, and then, if I find them,
I can safely bring them in without getting
stung,” said Farmer Joel. “It would be
strange if your children should be the means
of me finding my lost queen. I’d be very glad
to get her back.”</p>

<p>“Maybe the peddler boy could tell where
the bee tree is,” suggested Adam North.</p>

<p>“I guess he won’t want to talk about bees
for a long while,” chuckled Farmer Joel.
Dr. Snow had stopped at the farmhouse on
his way home after visiting the lad, and had
said the boy was badly stung.</p>

<p>“His face is swelled up like a balloon,”
said the physician, “and he can’t see out of his
eyes. If you want to find that honey tree,
Joel, you’ll have to look for it yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>And this Mr. Todd did the next day. As
there might be considerable walking to do,
only the four older children went along with
their father and Farmer Joel.</p>

<p>They reached the first picnic ground and
Rose pointed out the flat stump where the
lunch had been left before the peddler lad
took it. Then, as nearly as they could remember,
the children pointed out where in the
woods they saw the leaping, slapping peddler
boy. For it was there that the bees began to
sting him.</p>

<p>“And as so many came out at once it must
have been near their honey tree that it happened,”
said the farmer.</p>

<p>Laddie and Russ and the two girls followed
their father and Mr. Todd over into the
woods. It was very still and pleasant, the
sun shining down through the green leaves.</p>

<p>“I see some bees!” suddenly cried Laddie.
“There’s a whole procession of them.”</p>

<p>He pointed off to one side and there, flitting
through the sunlight and shadows of the
forest could be seen a number of bees—dark
bees with yellow stripes, or bands, on their
bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“That’s my kind of bees—the Italian sort,”
said Farmer Joel when he had observed two
or three near at hand gathering honey from
wild flowers.</p>

<p>“But where do they have their nest—I mean
their hive?” asked Russ.</p>

<p>“Oh, somewhere around here,” answered
Farmer Joel. “We must look for a hollow
tree. But move carefully. I don’t want any
of you to get stung, though I brought my
smoke machine. Guess I’ll start it going.”</p>

<p>He built a smudge fire inside the tin funnel
with the bellows beneath it, and soon smoke
was being puffed out into the air. This kept
the bees away from the searchers for the honey
tree.</p>

<p>Suddenly Russ exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I hear a humming sound. It’s like the
humming your bees make in their hives, Mr.
Joel.”</p>

<p>“I hear it, too,” said Violet.</p>

<p>They looked and listened, and then, off to
one side, they saw many bees flying in through
the hole in a tree. It was a hollow tree, that
was evident, and it was a dead one.</p>

<p>“Keep back, all of you,” said Farmer Joel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
“and I’ll soon find out if there are bees in
there.”</p>

<p>While the others moved back he tossed a
stick against the tree. It struck with a hollow
sound, and instantly a cloud of bees flew
out.</p>

<p>“There they are! My bees!” cried Farmer
Joel. “The queen must be with them, for the
bees wouldn’t stay and make honey without
a queen. Well, now that I know where they
are, I’ll mark this tree and when cold weather
comes I’ll come here and take my bees back
again—my bees and the fifty dollar queen.”</p>

<p>“Are you glad we helped you find them?”
asked Laddie.</p>

<p>“Indeed I am, little man! Thank you!”
said Farmer Joel. “And to-night you shall
have hot biscuits and honey for supper.”</p>

<p>Marking the location of the tree, so it could
easily be found again, Farmer Joel returned
to the house with Mr. Bunker, Russ and Laddie
and the two girls. They had found what
they set out to find, and later on, after the six
little Bunkers returned home, there came a
letter from Mr. Todd, saying he had gotten
his queen and swarm of bees back and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
also in the hollow tree was found fifty pounds
of good honey.</p>

<p>“My bees kept on working for me, even if
they ran away from home,” he said in the
letter.</p>

<p>With the finding of the lost swarm, the most
exciting adventures of the six little Bunkers
at Farmer Joel’s came to a close. They did
not return home at once, for summer was not
over and Miss Todd was not ready to come
home. But the peddler boy did not again
bother them.</p>

<p>From Dr. Snow it was learned that the shoe-lace
chap went back to the city to sell things
after his bee stings were cured. And I think
he never again took the picnic lunch of any
little boys and girls.</p>

<p>“Well, Mother, and children, we must soon
begin to think of getting back home,” said
Daddy Bunker, one day after a pleasant trip
in the woods and fields.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s too soon to go home yet!” sighed
Russ. “I want to stay until the pumpkins are
large enough to make into a jack-o’-lantern.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to gather some popcorn,” said
Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>“Couldn’t we stay until chestnuts are ripe?”
asked Laddie.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” said his father. “I must
get back to my real estate business, and you
children must get ready for school.”</p>

<p>But at least one wish came true, for a few
days later Farmer Joel brought into the house
a big yellow pumpkin that had ripened faster
than any of the others. Out of this Russ made
a jack-o’-lantern, and he and the children had
a jolly parade around the house that evening.</p>

<p>And so the summer of the six little Bunkers
at Farmer Joel’s came to an end, and they all
said it was one of the happiest times they had
ever spent.</p>
